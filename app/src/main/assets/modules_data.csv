AM6013#AIRLINE AND GROUND OPERATIONS#This module gives a descriptive account of the procedures involved for both airline and ground operations. Its shows how airline schedules are formulated to provide a system wide timetable and how flight and crews are qualified/approved in order to work on or operate specific aircraft types. The module also illustrates the various maintenance procedures that must be performed at specific intervals. Ground operations highlight the different processes that must be performed in synchronisation in order for the aircraft to be turned around and safely dispatched. Air cargo is another important component of the aviation industry and its operational characteristics are discussed. The module concludes by explaining the different ground procedures that are in-place for winter operations.# #
AM6023#AIRPORT BUSINESS#This module gives a detailed descriptive account of the airport industry and is aimed to give the MBA (Aviation Management) programme increased coverage of aviation. The module gives the student an in-depth view of the landing and passenger charges that airports apply and to examine an airports relationship with airlines. Increasing revenues generated from non aeronautical revenue streams show that airports are evolving their business model. Security has become paramount in todays aviation climate and the module details the components for a robust security plan. New innovative practices such as secondary airports and low cost terminals are studied while existing constraints such as environmental issues and slot controls are debated.# #
AM6036#AIRLINE SIMULATION AND PLANNING#The first quarter of the module comprises the running of several months of an airline simulation game, in competition with teams.  Each team will make decisions on routes, capacity, aircraft type, configuration, pricing and marketing. Over the trading period, one team will emerge as the most successful, measured by overall operating profit.   The second component will be the building of a business plan spreadsheet with outputs of Profit and Loss, Cash Flow, Balance Sheets and Start-up capital requirements for a new airline to European rules. Teams will assess the business opportunity set against data supplied for market size, competitive environment, operating revenues and costs. Assessment will be made on the credibility of each teams forecasts, accuracy and completeness of cost inputs, revenue projections and a team presentation.# #

AP5001#PLACEMENT - PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN APA#This module takes the form of a short series of lectures and a supervised placement in a specialist provider (day or residential) for children or adults with disabilities in Limerick. Optimally, the placement will take place on two or three days a week for 12 weeks although this is flexible depending on the needs of the service providers and users and the logistical and resource constraints of the providers. The placement will give students the opportunity to use and reflect upon the professional competencies they already have, adapt them to new situations and develop and practice new skills and techniques for designing, planning and carrying out physical activity programs for children or adults with a range of disabilities. The placement experience will be set up and managed by the module coordinator and preceded by a short series of lectures on reflective practice which prepares the students for undertaking a reflective journal as one of the module assessment strategies. Students will be assessed on the success of their placement and through their journal both of which are designed to address critical self-awareness, the ability to identify meaning in the experiences the students have and the ability to build on this in contributing to the empowerment and emancipation of people with disabilities.# #
AP5002#PARTICIPATION IN PRACTICE IN SPECIALISED CENTRES#Students are placed in a crentre or school in the area where they can work with children/adults who have disabilities. They will be under the expert supervision based in the centre. Tutors from the University of Limerick may make an occasional visit to assist with research method and procedure (if applicable). Ethical standards of both of the HSE where the Centres are located and the University of Limerick will be rigorously applied. This experience may enhance students to realise the work that the student is engaged in the field of APA. A reflective diary of the experience will be written during the process.  *#Spring#
AP5011#DANCE PEDAGOGY AND INCLUSIVE PRACTICE#This module seeks to engage you in the current thinking about the principles and practices of dance education. Topics will include: dance and inclusive education, dance and gender, the body and selfesteem, creative education, aesthetic awareness, the international dance education scene, dance curriculum issues. The students¿ learning experience will be through lectures, practical dance laboratory, which will combine viewing video, reading, analysis, written responses and on line discussion. The use of electronic tutorials will form a central part of the dialogue between student and lecturer. Students will be assessed through seminar presentation of a selected approach to teaching and learning in dance and an critical reflection on that approach using current literature sources.# #
AP5012#RESEARCH BASED SEMINARS RELATED TO PRACTICAL TRAINING#The student will make three presentations.  The first is a seminar and will be based on * * a framework of the literature covering the specific subject area of interest  * * defining the problem and the research hypothesis  * * the experimental design and logistics including milestones.   The second is a seminar and will be an interim review on progress on methodology, recruitment, experimental work, problems encountered and solutions offered.    The third is a Poster Presentation of the thesis data.#Spring#
AP5022#RESEARCH PROJECT#Students will attend regular weekly tutorials with a supervisor who is responsible for guiding the student in the process of understanding how to undertake a research project. Collecting and analyzing data will be supervised both by experts in the field of disability and by experienced tutors based at the University of Limerick.  This module aims to provide students with appropriate supervision and tutorial guidance to engage in independent research on a topic of their choice that is relevant to Adapted Physical Activity.  This will allow students to conduct independent research through a substantive experience of a research-led environment.#Spring#
AP5032#CURRENT TRENDS AND ISSUES IN APA / APE#This module will allow students to become familiar with current trends and issues that relate exclusively to adapted physical activity (APA) and adapted physical education (APE). In doing so, students will learn to critically compare, appraise, and clarify the fields of APA and APE from both a European and broader international perspective paying particular attention to how these fields connect to various areas (i.e. rehabilitation, sport, society, inclusion, and access). Additionally, students will explore and understand current state-of-the-art electronic and traditional research resources as well as relevant methodological concepts in APA in order to identify ways to further its scientific basis. As a final culminating learning event, students will plan, organise, and offer a series of seminars disseminating information on various trends and issues chosen by the students. These specially designed seminars will be presented to peers, academic faculty, and other professionals in APA.# #
AP5091#DISSERTATION 1 (EMMAPA)#Through a series of lectures and tutorials with their designated supervisor, students will be guided through the process of initiating and undertaking the preliminary stages of a dissertation. They will be expected to choose an experimental design suitable for use with people who have a disability. Depending on the chosen paradigm/theoretical framework, this might involve applying existing experimental designs or adapting them or creating new ones. Each student will be allocated a supervisor from within EHS to oversee the project and tutor them through these early stages. Ethical issues and standards in APA will be considered if the research design demands it and part of the module syllabus (but not assessment) will be the successful application for ethical approval for the project from EHSREC or PESSREC. For assessment students will submit a research proposal and be guided to further develop written, oral and visual presentation skills through a summative seminar presentation which will give them the opportunity to report on, evaluate and get feedback on the early stages of their research design.# #
AP5092#DISSERTATION 2 (EMMAPA)#With their designated supervisor students will be guided through data analysis, discussion and conclusion stages of their dissertation. They will be expected to implement their approved experimental design suitable for use with people who have a disability. Each step in the process of collecting and analyzing data will be supervised by their supervisor within EHS.  Ethical issues and standards in APA will be have been approved by EHSREC or PESSREC in semester 1. The project outcome will either be a 15,000 word thesis presentation or in the format of a proposed journal article which follows the submission criteria for a relevant journal. The choice of journal will be negotiated between the student and their supervisor but successful completion of this module assignment will not be determined by acceptance of the article for publication. Students will also be guided to further develop written, oral and visual presentation skills with a summative poster presentation and viva after the dissertation has been submitted.# #

AR4000#LIMERICK: LOCAL HISTORY AND URBAN GOVERNANCE IN ARCHITECTURE#This module explores the past, present and future of Limerick as a place in the west of Ireland. It examines key instances of Limerick's history and the resultant urban structures. Further, it addresses current and emerging processes of urban design and place-based planning governance, with an emphasis on the design of civic spaces. It investigates, particularly, contemporary examples of interdisciplinary and collaborative practices in urban design and emerging, bottom-up approaches to place making. The module develops a context for understanding the role of design in shaping the urban environment, both physically and culturally.   Readings, lectures, case studies, field trips and assignments introduce Limerick as a place and provide a conceptual grounding for understanding the link between place, governance and design. Interaction with local authority personnel and with community leaders provide a basis for developing an understanding of critical issues affecting the development of a particular place. Through practical application, mapping as a creative as well as analytical practice is tested in terms of its ability to assist evidence based decision-making.# #Jan.Frohburg@ul.ie
AR4001#DESIGN STUDIO 1A#Design Studio is the backbone of study in Architecture. Study is organised around design æproblemsÆ or projects, a number of which are given each term.   By working through the project, the student will become exposed to the architectural design process, a new and complex process for most first year students.  Each project introduces a different aspect of the architectural design process in order to help the student develop a range of methods of working.    Each project also introduces a new programmatic theme so that students understand and become conversant with the many fields of operation of an architect.  Themes include space and light explorations through model making, understanding the process of abstraction and transformation through model making/two dimensional work,  building full scale structures in timber to explore architectural concepts such as scale, framing, section and thresholds, developing observational skills through sketching on site, learning how to make a site plan by developing a pattern of occupation on an open site, learning how to develop a building design grounded in this context.  Studio work is organised so that close contact is maintained with the student.  Work is analysed and discussed with the student on an individual basis and within the group.  The student is taught to recognise the design process and to value and catalogue their own work.  As the year progresses the student is encouraged to become increasingly responsible for organising and developing their own work process.  The studio is co-ordinated with the content of parallel course modules and integration between studio work and course module work is a vital and innovative component of the studio structure.#Autumn#Grainne.Hassett@ul.ie

AR4005#DESIGN STUDIO 3A#An agenda will be set in Design Studio. The basis for all propositions will have stated intent relative to societal ideas of place, collectivity and socio economic (or political) meaning. The architectural project brief will have inherent complexity, embodying personal space together with public space.  Through the detailed study of architectural references, a concept of `now¿ relative to the past history of societal and architectural ideas will inform each student¿s proposition since both will be researched and presented in parallel. The material realisation of these social and cultural concepts is capable of conveying meaning in a contribution that the strictly functional provision of buildings does not make.  The architectural proposition will move through a series of studies where the student is taught to use different scales, modes of operation and reference points. The emphasis will be on the mastery of investigative skills through a range of media on an ongoing basis.#Autumn#

AR4007#DESIGN STUDIO 4A#In Y4 students start a personal pursuit; they must - through their design projects and their research work - relate to the world of architecture in their own personal way. Students are expected and asked to voice their position in architecture, to find their direction through architectural design. Students develop a method of research and allocate significant time to the research part of the curriculum. The architectural project is tightly allied to construction and the physicality of building; construction technology is an important part of the years work. A research led project in the autumn semester opens the expanse of architectural intelligence into circumscribed cultural and environmental fields. Students develop a fluency in the means of making of and thinking through things in terms of structure, technology, and environment to the point where they can rise above the practicalities and conceptualise as well.# #Elizabeth.Hatz@ul.ie

AR4021#REPRESENTATION / DRAWING 1#To establish drawing as a tool of observation, a tool of thinking and a tool of representation, this course is composed of two different types of drawing exercises:   Studio based exercises with weekly changing subjects introducing key aspects of architectural vocabulary (light and space, site, human scale, skin and comfort, flows and organisation, vision and architecture).  Short introducing lectures are followed by a drawing or sketching exercise, and, in the next step by a model making exercise, where the drawings from the exercise have to be interpreted and transformed into the 3rd dimension.  Contents of both exercises as well as the chosen format, materials and techniques are directly related to the particular subject.  As subject matter, each session will be organized around a specific theme from art, photography, film, dance, architecture  Exercises in architectural drawing in a conventional sense, line drawings of floor plans, sections and details in pencil, are introduced within an extensive lecture, then elaborated by the students as far as possible self-dependently and later on reviewed.  In both parts of the course curriculum hand drawing with pencil is emphasized in order to develop within the students a sensitivity to the medium.  Exercises are on opaque white paper so as to prevent tracing and use of construction aids.#Autumn#Declan.Feeney@ul.ie
AR4022#REPRESENTATION / DRAWING 2#To establish drawing as a tool of observation, a tool of thinking and a tool of representation, this course consists of  three  different types of drawing exercises:  Studio based exercises will, by degrees shift their focus from training the craft of technique  in drawing toward using drawing as an analytical and representation technique. Colour, composition, documentation of different sites û with some visits to specific sites - , typography and basics of graphic design will be subjects of the course. Ink and pastels will be introduced as drawing materials, wood, plexiglas and metals as model making materials.   The idea of transformation introduced in the first semester of the course will be extended to include digital media.   Learning how digital media operates and is distinct and different from activities of drawing and model making photoshop and powerpoint will be the first steps into digital representation.   Architectural drawing, line-drawings of floor plans, sections and details, will become more concrete, will develop from freehand to hard line drawings following the convention of architectural drawing in respect of line types, hatching, representing materials, dimensioning, lettering and grade of detailing depending on scale.#Spring#Declan.Feeney@ul.ie

AR4031#HISTORY AND THEORY OF ARCHITECTURE 1#The theme for the fall workshop is Site. Objectifying and describing a site is typically difficult for beginning, or even advanced students, and yet is a skill all architects must master. Site is the precondition for construction and the link between architecture and the world. With forms of human habitation rapidly changing due to urbanization, site becomes a more important consideration every day.  Seminars will address Fields, Territories, Surveys, Flows, and Contexts, surveying both historical and contemporary material to challenge students. As an introduction to architecture as an expanded field, students will encounter disciplines such as politics, geology, philosophy, infrastructural engineering, land art, archaeology, and landscape architecture. Buildings will illustrate responses to the topics and students will encounter a selection of the most significant works in modern and contemporary architecture. Projects discussed include HaussmannÆs Boulevards, the Paris Opera, MiesÆs Friedrichstrasse Skyscraper, the Villa Savoye, the Barcelona Pavilion, the Bauhaus, ArchigramÆs Instant City , SuperstudioÆs Continuous Monument, Herzog and de MeuronÆs Signal Box Auf dem Wolf, and the Sendai Mediatheque. Readings by authors such as Rem Koolhaas, Colin Rowe, Michel Foucault, St. Brendan, Guy Debord, John McPhee, John Stilgoe, Robert Smithson, and Georg Simmel will challenge students with the diverse ways by which we can describe sites.  We will visit three nearby sites first-hand in order to learn how to discuss them. Afternoon writing workshops will focus on describing these sites.#Autumn#Kazys.Varnelis@ul.ie
AR4032#HISTORY AND THEORY OF ARCHITECTURE 2#The theme for the spring workshop is Building. Just as students need to learn to describe a site and objectify their reactions to it, as architects it is essential that they also learn to discuss buildings at a high level.  Seminars will address Skin, Program, Circulation, Structure, and Codes, introducing both historical and contemporary material to challenge students. Throughout, students will explore architectureÆs intersection with the material and social realms. As in the first semester, students will undertake close readings of the most significant works in modern and contemporary architecture. Projects likely to be discussed will include Joseph PaxtonÆs Crystal Palace, Otto WagnerÆs Postparkasse, Mies van der RoheÆs 860-880 Lake Shore Drive and Seagram Buildings, Le CorbusierÆs La Tourette, Eero SaarinenÆs IBM Headquarters, Bernard TschumiÆs Parc de la Villette, FOAÆs Yokohama Terminal, MVRDVÆs WoZoCos Housing Project. Readings by authors such as Robin Evans, Colin Rowe, Anthony Vidler, Otto Wagner, Alan Colquhoun, Le Corbusier, and Walter Gropius will explore the diverse ways by which buildings can be discussed.  We will visit nearby sites first-hand in order to learn how to read buildings. Afternoon workshops will focus on describing these sites. The writing projects introduced in the fall semester will be built upon in order to ensure that students have a high degree of skill in thinking about architecture through writing by the end of the term.  This course will be teamed with a series of workshops by Elizabeth Hatz that will introduce students to ways of attaining close readings of buildings through drawing.#Spring#Jan.Frohburg@ul.ie
AR4033#HISTORY AND THEORY OF ARCHITECTURE 3#The first part of the course deals with ways of looking at the history of land and society; people, time, place (methodological with material from the Mediterranean, Ireland and Limerick). It will include several Case Studies: Irish building land 1600-2000 (ownership, tenure, land reform, rural and urban populations), building the city; Limerick 1200-2000 (racial, social and religious segregation over time), and deal with the shape of the city: (Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque and Industrial ideals of the city, with emphasis on land use in relation to buildings and spaces between buildings, building land in Ireland today; not about the law but about trends, patterns, densities.  The second part of the course is a contemporary theoretical survey of key theoretical aspects of modern architecture that exposes students to the monuments of the modern movement. The course focuses on the body in modernism, e. g. the body in an emergent consumer environment and visual culture (Joseph PaxtonÆs Crystal Palace, the department stores, the arcades), as an agent of production and instrument of sensation (William Morris, Art Nouveau, the Secessionstil), in motion (Frank Lloyd Wright, the Werkbund, Futurism, de Stijl), in a culture of hygiene (Tony Garnier, Le CorbusierÆs urbanism, the Suburb), at home and in exhibition (the International Style, the Schindler House, the Eames House, the Farnsworth House, JohnsonÆs Glass House), and nomadic (Team X, Kurokawa, the SmithsonÆs House of the Future, Archigram).#Autumn#Anna.Ryan@ul.ie
AR4034#HISTORY AND THEORY OF ARCHITECTURE 4#Continuing the survey from the first term, the period covered will be from 1945 to the present day, course will survey not simply the history of modern architecture, but the history of environmental, structural, and social systems in such terms.  The course is composed of Lectures, seminars, writing workshops, together with research papers.#Spring#Irenee.Scalbert@ul.ie
AR4035#HISTORY AND THEORY OF ARCHITECTURE 5#Through lectures, discussion seminars, and writing the course will survey the relationship between architecture, materials, and technology from prehistory to the present day.  Starting with the classical Greek and Roman periods, into the present day ôSilicon Age,ö both society and architecture have been profoundly influenced by materials and technology. This course will be composed of a research and readings on the period by experts in the history of science and technology, Irish history, structural engineering, materials science, structures, and the history of architecture.  Students will complete their own directed research projects on a particular work of architcture, and encounter the work directly, making observations from experience with the physical object.#Autumn#Irenee.Scalbert@ul.ie
AR4036#HISTORY AND THEORYOF ARCHITECTURE  6#Through lectures, discussion seminars, field trips, and writing the course will survey urban history from prehistory to the present day.

Students will construct from actual data (weather data, etc.) models realistic assessments of a buildings environmental performance.#Spring#Graham.Petrie@ul.ie
AR4055#CULTURE, PLACE AND ENVIRONMENT 1#In the history of art and architecture, there are moments when a new order emerges. This module, through an examination of drawings, built work and work practices, traces the links between the emergence of a new order and the practice of the person who brings it into being. This module investigates in some detail the work of several practitioners through time, and as a specific example, will also examine the relationship of three practitioners, the painter Bridget Riley, the sculptor Donald Judd and the architect Kazuyo Sejima, to the progress of their work and situates this in the context of the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.#Autumn#Simon.Walker@ul.ie
AR4056#ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS AND FORCES 5#Understanding precisely how the performance of an integrated and unrelated set of elements will perform in a specific environment comes through simulation, modelling and analysis. Both analogue and digital means of simulation will be taught. Daylight modelling, building fabric U-value calculations, air-tightness, and CFD modelling of buildings are some examples of the types of essential simulation during the design process. The emphasis of the course is on the acquiring analytical techniques and skills required to evaluate the environmental performance of a set of elements under a specific condition.   Building on observation, analysis and design, students will develop skills for critical inquiry into the nature of architectural design and how it engages with the concepts of site, place and comfort. The idea of `boundary conditions¿ will be developed in the context of an integrated understanding of structure + environment + materials.    The following subjects will be covered:   Day-lighting and artificial lighting design in relation to a large-scale physical model  Thermal energy losses and gains through envelope   Performance of a building in relation to air movement inside and outside (applied CFD modelling tools)  Material selection and embodied energy considerations  Energy/Water/Waste systems integration/design#Spring#Graham.Petrie@ul.ie

AR4068#ADVANCED CONSTRUCTION 2#Architecture students learn best by imagining, developing and realising (full¿scale) prototype structures through which ideas can be tested, documented and communicated. Through actual engagement in all the stages of making and building, students have a unique opportunity to develop a rich phenomenal understanding of architecture. Closely related to Design Studio, Advanced Construction informs and supports the students individual design studio projects; directed and independent research on advanced construction is applied to these projects. Students test radical and experimental alternatives to the conventional processes of building because architecture is facing unprecedented pressure to reinvent itself in response to a new set of economic and environmental realities. The responsibility to pre¿empt the needs of future built environments demands new approaches. The modules provide an overview of advanced building construction at an industrial scale and with respect to contemporary, emerging and innovative technologies. Students study the design implications of new construction technologies, and investigate precedents and potential applications.# #Morgan.Flynn@ul.ie
AR4073#DESIGN STUDIO 2A#Phase I Using mapping as a vehicle for speculative architectural analysis, students will map one defined aspect of a particular place as ground, infrastructure, climate and occupation of space.  Through mapping, students will confront their first analysis with more specific information: climate, ground, geology, built structures, growing structures, water treatment and flows, infrastructural networks, historic traces, land use and occupation of space.  It is about identification of specifics through drawing, registering, measuring, timing, investigating; observe on site at several occasions and document, explain conditions, situations, make drawings, diagrams and sketches to explain conditions  Phase II Explore settings for physical activity and for the interconnection that happens between spectator and sport and between land and the body.  Cultural and technical characteristics of sport must be integrated into the land in a way, which will change it consciously.  Students first make a first landscape urban proposition (MODEL) plus make a set of drawings showing dimensional sizes for activities include heights PLANS, SECTIONS, Make a set of investigations of three different structures and how they work with the land.  Development Synthesis Two: Choreography, colour, light, material, crowd versus the individual delineation, studies Development Draw Up and review MODEL  The design studio is co-ordinated with the content of parallel course modules and integration between studio work and course module work is a vital and innovative component of the studio structure.#Autumn#
AR4099#DESIGN STUDIO 5A - PRE THESIS#Fifth-year Design Studio invites the student to engage with complex large-scale architectural design problems. These problems aim to enable multiple scales and programmes to be managed within a tight set of constraints, both physical and temporal. Students will deepen the strength, breadth and application of their conceptual approach and will integrate increasingly sophisticated structural and environmental solutions at a large scale.  Thesis will be a year-long piece of work, initiated by a proposition written at the start of the autumn semester. This proposition is tested against a theme (rather than a place) and will act as a framework within which ideas are developed. Students are invited to engage in sharpening architectural positions and idioms, and refining design methods, in the context of contemporary society and in relation to current architectural and cultural debates. Through explorative projects and research, students situate their work on an expanding platform for discussion, engaging with current issues facing the city and the region, related to both national and international contexts.# #Merritt.Bucholz@ul.ie
AR4310#ADVANCED CONSTRUCTION 4#The series of modules in Advanced Construction expands the scope of students competencies in building technologies and construction beyond traditional methods and their related familiar scale. In the final year, students engage in a tested dialogue with concerns of design, structure, environment, history and theory, representation, digital media, and other related areas and interests. Students undertake a Technical Design Thesis, contextualised as part of a broader dialogue in which the technical and architectural agendas that arise within the year are synthesised. The constructional or technological proposition is pursued critically and developed imaginatively through case studies, material experiments, extensive research and consultation.# #Merritt.Bucholz@ul.ie
AR4317#Advanced Construction 1#Architecture students learn best by imagining, developing and realising (full¿scale) prototype structures through which ideas can be tested, documented and communicated. Through actual engagement in all the stages of making and building, students have a unique opportunity to develop a rich phenomenal understanding of architecture. Closely related to Design Studio, Advanced Construction informs and supports the students individual design studio projects; directed and independent research on advanced construction is applied to these projects.  After revisiting traditional and conventional (vernacular) forms of building taxonomy and production techniques in a range of materials (stone, concrete, metal, timber, fabric and polymers) staff and students engage more advanced means of fabrication (including milling, folding, laminating, sewing, stacking, interlocking, hanging, injection moulding, compositing, extrusion, weaving and bundling). Spatially and programmatically this will entail various degrees of articulation from the standardised, low¿tech component to the highly articulated formal element, avoiding self¿similar repetition in favour of the diversity of the composite.# #Morgan.Flynn@ul.ie

Staff and student undertake in-depth research into specialist areas of technology. Case studies focus is on an integration of structural and environmental systems in response to specific conditions that require complex skills in analysis and/or design. The students are expected to apply findings from directed and independent research on advanced construction technologies to develop each student¿s thesis proposal individually.# #Merritt.Bucholz@ul.ie
AR4327#Culture Place Environment (Building Land)#Architecture electives provide a flexible framework to accommodate (short-term) research projects on a wide spectrum of issues, and to allow students to pursue their own personal interests within architecture. Focusing on case studies, the elective module will be delivered through a programme of lectures, seminar discussions and case study presentations. - The subject matter can change depending on the interest and availability of academic staff.  There are many ways of reading, examining, explaining and presenting the city. How the city represents itself or rather the aesthetic of the city is dependent on so many flows and forces. Our relationship with the city is constantly under interrogation simply because as the environment of the city changes just so we change in response. This module proposes to interrogate the evolution of the constructed territory. It hopes to build an understanding of relations within the given environment concurrent with their historical importance and their place in the canon of the built place.# #Morgan.Flynn@ul.ie

AR6001#DESIGN STUDIO 1 (GRADUATE ENTRY)#This design studio enables graduate entry students to learn and to demonstrate a first synthesis of the disparate and multi-layered contingent ideas and thought processes that compose architectural thinking and are expressed through an architectural project using the full range of an architect's skills and tools. The emphasis in the first term is on building skills, developing architectural research and response, and producing a relevant design proposal illustrated by a set of competent design documents. An agenda will be set in the Design Studio. All design propositions must be situated by the student relative to societal ideas of environment, climate, place, collectivity and socio economic, or political intent.. The design project's brief is inherently complex, embodying the public sphere, the private sphere, and their increasingly complex interaction. Through the detailed study of architectural references, a concept of 'now' relative to the past history of societal and architectural ideas informs individual proposition since both will be researched and presented in parallel. The material realisation of these social and cultural concepts must be capable of conveying meaning in a contribution that the strictly functional provision of buildings does not make. The architectural proposition moves through a series of studies where the student learns to use different scales, modes of operation and reference points. In the process, students acquire design competencies and master investigative skills through a range of media on an on-going basis. Students assemble and present their final design proposal alongside documentation of a critically reviewed design process in a portfolio.# #
AR6002#DESIGN STUDIO 2 (GRADUATE ENTRY)#This design studio challenges graduate entry students to develop their design intelligence and to respond creatively to conflicting demands in terms of place, programme and construction. The emphasis in the second term is on developing a fluency in expressing intent through drawing, and integrating considerations of structure and construction into a competent design proposal. A broader agenda will be set in the Design Studio. All design propositions have to state ambition and intent relative to societal ideas of culture and technology. The design project's brief is increasingly complex, further differentiating between private, collective and public spaces. Through the detailed study of advanced architectural references, a concept of 'now' relative to the past history of societal and architectural ideas informs individual proposition since both will be researched and presented in parallel. The material realisation of these social and cultural concepts is capable of conveying meaning in a contribution that the strictly functional provision of buildings does not make. The architectural proposition moves through a series of studies where the student applies and further refines the use different scales, modes of operation and reference points. In the process, students develop their design competencies to an intermediate level and exploit investigative skills through a range of media on an on-going basis. Students assemble and present their final design proposal alongside documentation of a critically reviewed design process in a portfolio.# #
AR6003#GRADUATE DESIGN PROJECT 1#Graduate students are asked to voice their position in architecture, to define their direction through architectural design in a differentiated and mature manner. The architectural project is tightly allied to construction and the physicality of building. Students apply their fluency in the making of and thinking through 'things' (in terms of structural concepts, construction technologies, building materials and environmental responses) at an advanced level, working through the practicalities towards a conceptualised approach.# #
AR6004#GRADUATE DESIGN PROJECT 2#Graduate students are expected to voice their position in architecture, to define their direction through architectural design in a differentiated and mature manner. The architectural project will be tightly allied to an interrogation of constructed territories and concepts of urbanism. Through creating a complex architectural object, students measure their design ability against tightly drawn demands and complex programmatic issues within a sophisticated cultural and architectural framework. Successful projects require an integrated technological proposition in terms of structure, construction, materials and environment at an advanced level.# #
AR6005#GRADUATE THESIS PROJECT 1#The year-long Graduate Thesis challenges students to engage with complex architectural design problems. These problems aim to enable multiple scales and programmes to be managed within a tight set of constraints, both physical and temporal. Students will deepen the strength, breadth and application of their conceptual approach and will integrate increasingly sophisticated structural and environmental solutions at a large scale.   Graduate students are expected to engage in sharpening architectural positions and idioms, and refining design methods at an advanced level and in the context of contemporary society and in relation to current architectural and cultural debates. Through explorative projects and research, students situate their work on an expanding platform for discussion, engaging with current issues facing the city and the region, related to both national and international contexts.# #
AR6006#GRADUATE THESIS PROJECT 2#The year-long Graduate Thesis challenges students to engage with complex architectural design problems. These problems aim to enable multiple scales and programmes to be managed within a tight set of constraints, both physical and temporal. Students will deepen the strength, breadth and application of their conceptual approach and will integrate increasingly sophisticated structural and environmental solutions at a large scale.   Graduate Thesis Project is a summing up and a synthesising of the architect as a thinker, as a maker, as a doer, and as a responsible actor within the dynamic framework of society, able to contribute with the profession of architecture. Graduate students will develop a highly disciplined process and way of working in the organisation of spaces, flows, systems and structures; they will apply geometry and structural logic, and relate their sophisticated proposal to a complex urban or natural environment.# #
AR6011#HISTORY, THEORY AND CRITICISM IN ARCHITECTURE#Through lectures, discussion seminars, and writing this module provides a broad introduction to architecture throughout the ages and a comprehensive survey of the history of urbanism. It familiarises graduate entry students with architecture's relationship to technology and materials, both naturally occurring and those produced by man, both in Ireland and globally. Also, it exposes students to urban history. In parallel, students are introduced to theories that informed the conception of key buildings in their time and/or provide a critical framework for their evaluation today. Students complete individual research on particular works of architecture, and encounter these works directly, comparing the experience of the physical object to observations made through prior investigation.# #
AR6012#VISUAL CULTURE AND EXPRESSION#In general, the architectural project takes time, and it moves through a series of modes and a series of technological, regulatory and economic inputs. This module offers a critique of this fragmented approach, which, it seems, interferes with and determines our capacity to generate spatial, or pictorial, order through a greater understanding of a visual world as operated upon by artists, with a particular focus on their means of engagement. This module, through an examination of drawings, built work and work practices, traces the links between the emergence of a new order and the practice of the person who brings it into being. This module investigates in some detail the work of several practitioners through time. Far from being purely theoretical, in this module graduate entry students hone their skills in drawing through practising, and form an understanding of its potential of expression and insight through application. In order to establish drawing as a tool of observation, of thinking and of representation, this module comprises different types of drawing exercises. Students produce a set of thematic drawings that survey existing structures, record information and express intent visually with respect to exactitude, proportion and scale. - The module provides opportunity for collaborative projects with lecturers, tutors and students from the Limerick School of Arts and Design.# #
AR6013#GRADUATE DESIGN RESEARCH 1#Students develop a method of research and allocate significant time to the research part of the curriculum. Design research introduces an expanse of architectural intelligence into circumscribed cultural, technological and environmental fields; it facilitates more inventive and experimental work. Through their research work, and their associated design projects, graduate students relate to the world of architecture in their own personal way, identifying areas of specific concern to them.# #
AR6014#GRADUATE DESIGN RESEARCH 2#Students expand their methods of research and allocate significant time to the research part of the curriculum. Design research leverages the students' advanced skills and knowledge; it enforces a sense of research for design and research by design. Through their research work, and their associated design projects, graduate students relate to considerations of 'land' and man's relationship to it as the determining characteristic of Irish culture, and strive to establish 'land' with its broad cultural and environmental implications as the leading concern in architectural design.# #
AR6015#GRADUATE THESIS DISSERTATION 1#The year-long Graduate Thesis challenges students to engage with complex architectural design problems. It is initiated by a proposition written at the start of the autumn semester, and expanded further throughout the year. This proposition is tested against a theme (rather than a place) and provides a theoretical framework within which the design concept is developed. This module is an opportunity to acquire new skills in research and writing. Graduate students are expected to enter into an intellectual dialogue with concepts at the forefront for architecture (and other disciplines). Framed in a workshop format and pursued as an on-going project in parallel with the search for a design brief, dissertation writing produces a 'progressive' piece of work capable of generating, exploring and communicating many aspects of the architectural design project.# #
AR6016#GRADUATE THESIS DISSERTATION 2#The year-long Graduate Thesis challenges students to engage with complex architectural design problems. The initial proposition is qualified further during the spring semester and expanded to provided a comprehensive and detailed description of the design project. The proposition is placed within a theoretical framework that supports both thematic and localised approaches. Developing existing skills in research and writing, graduate students are expected to put forward a coherent and original argument in support of their design project. Pursued as an on-going project in parallel with developing the design proposal, dissertation writing produces a 'progressive' piece of work capable of generating, exploring and communicating many aspects of the architectural design project.# #
AR6021#DIGITAL REPRESENTATION#This module introduces the computer and related modes of representation, in conjunction with studies in hand drawing. Software introduced spans from standard applications in text and image processing (Word, Photoshop), in graphic design (Illustrator, InDesign) and 3D-modelling (SketchUp) to advanced applications in CAD (VectorWorks) and parametric freeform modelling (FormZ, Rhino). In this module graduate entry students develop skills in 3-dimensional modelling as a tool of spatial investigation and representation using the computer, parallel to studies in physical modelling. Switching between virtual and analogue modes of representation (e.g. models, drawings, digital photography and image processing, CAD and 3D-modelling) explores the validity and performance of digital tools in the transformation of spatial, logical, and structural exploration. Students develop in parallel their hand drawings skills. Moving actively between analogue and digital modes of representation, students develop their ideas between media, exploiting the most powerful aspects of each in terms of their design.# #
AR6022#ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS AND FORCES#This module provides a comprehensive overview of the physical backgrounds and interconnectedness of sustainable development and design. The emphasis is on acquiring analytical techniques and skills required to evaluate the environmental performance of a set of elements under a specific condition. The module content spans from global to local and micro climate, and covers energy in its different forms and sources including materials and its embodied energy. The following subjects are covered: natural and artificial lighting design, thermal energy losses and gains through envelope, CFD modelling of air movement within and outside of a building, material selection and embodied energy considerations, energy/water/waste systems integration in design. The module introduces both analogue and digital means of simulation. Building on observation, analysis and design graduate entry students will develop skills for critical inquiry into the nature of architectural design and how it engages with the concepts of site, place and comfort. Students conduct experiments, research and apply methods to analyse, design and test the environmental aspects of buildings, including: U-values calculations, building envelope integrity tests, daylight tests. Using actual data (weather, daylight etc.) students construct realistic models to assess a building's environmental performance. Students develop a working understanding of various methods of assessment such as BREEAM or¿LEED. Each student shall be able to carry out detailed analysis of a proposed building envelope design based on understanding of façade arrangements, materials, insulation, orientation, climate, comfort and use - the boundary conditions that define the relationship of interior and exterior space. These studies will inform the integrated design of a detailed section of the building.# #
AR6023#ADVANCED CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY#The module revisits traditional (vernacular) and conventional ways of building in a range of materials. Further, it provides an overview of advanced construction methods at an industrial scale and with respect to contemporary, emerging and innovative technologies. Graduate students undertake a Technical Dissertation, in-depth research into specialist areas of technology, contextualised as part of a broader dialogue in which the technical and architectural agendas that arise within the year are synthesised. The constructional or technological proposition is pursued critically and developed imaginatively through case studies, material experiments, extensive research and consultation. Students study the design implications of new construction technologies, and investigate precedents and potential applications. In response to a new set of economic and environmental realities and the resulting need to re-invent architecture, students test radical and experimental alternatives to the conventional processes of building. By imagining, developing and realising (full¿scale) prototype structures in various degrees of articulation from the standardised, low¿tech component to the highly articulated formal element ideas can be tested, documented and communicated. Through actual engagement in all the stages of making and building, students have a unique opportunity to develop a rich phenomenal understanding of architecture.# #
AR6024#PROFESSION AND PRACTICE OF ARCHITECTURE#The module provides an understanding of detailed aspects of architecture as a profession. It examines how society influences practice through law, the media, through action and vice versa. Students acquire a working knowledge of the principles of the laws and regulation pertaining to the built environment and other aspects of the building process including drawings and specifications as well as conduct of the architect, leadership of a design team and administration of site processes. Students learn to identity and describe different statutory functions and processes, and to distinguish between them. The particular roles and responsibilities of the architect, the client, contractors, the State and others in these processes are explained. The module introduces particular ways of working that result from a search for 'relevance' for the profession of architecture in society and discusses the relationship between risk and innovation.# #

AR6031#STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS: GRAVITY AND REACTION#Through experiments, lectures and project work students are given a strong conceptual and formal grasp of materials and approaches used in structural design, as applicable to actual conditions. This module provides a comprehensive introduction to basic and advanced structural concepts. These concepts are analysed, tested and assessed with regards to their application in architectural design. Materials used in structural design are introduced: masonry, reinforced concrete, steel and timber (including glue-lam and engineered timber); composite structures are also discussed. Graduate entry students develop a working knowledge of structural principles: load paths and stresses (tension, compression, shear, axial and eccentric load), failure modes, lateral stability. They apply structural typologies in their designs: support, span and cantilever, portal frame, arch, crane structure, RC beam and steel/timber truss, shell, membrane. In the process, students estimate and calculate basic dimensions for structural members. Students study different types of foundations and problems of long-span and high-rise structures.# #
AR6032#CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS: CODING, ORGANISING AND MANAGING INFORMATION#This module reviews fundamental construction principles through the detailed study of building elements. Building technology is considered from the point of view of design intent, logic of assembly and the quality of the resulting climate, environment and comfort. The suitability of various forms of construction to different design ambitions is also considered. Irish Building Regulations are introduced. Graduate entry students develop intuitive concepts of construction alongside knowledge of available building technology today. In the process, students understand the size and dimensions of various constructional elements and building systems. Students define a construction system according to personal interest and produce a comprehensive set of working drawings of their design project.# #

In Year 2, these units are again visited but in far greater depth than in Year 1.  This approach ensures that the programme in the first two years is vertically integrated.#Autumn#Helena.Mckeague@ul.ie
BM4003#GENERAL PRACTICE / PRIMARY CARE#This module is outcome driven in that teaching and learning is directed at the attainment of competence in the diagnosis and management of a range of problems commonly encountered in general practice. There are 45 such conditions and these are provided in the appendix to this module.  For each condition students will develop knowledge of common causes and classifications; incidence and prevalence; pathogenesis and pathophysiology; clinical features and characteristic findings from investigations; differential diagnoses; clinical course; management principles; prognosis and prevention. For a period of 18 weeks in the General Practice setting students actively engage in the management of the full spectrum of patients that present to the practice. It is expected that students will encounter something in the region of 10 patients per day on average, generating close to 1000 patient contacts over the 18 week placement. They participate in a range of clinical activities, attend lectures, clinical skills sessions and tutorials and undertake self directed learning.#Autumn#
BM4004#MEDICINE#The Core Curriculum in Medicine is `outcome focused¿, being centred on 100 clinical conditions relevant to medicine that all students must be able to manage by the time of their graduation (see Appendix C).  This list of conditions has been derived from two related 2003 publications: Objectives for the Qualifying Examination produced by the Medical Council of Canada and Anthology of Medical Conditions produced by the Australian Medical Council.  There are a number of specific objectives for each of these 100 clinical medical conditions and these span items of knowledge, clinical skills and attitudes.    As clinical conditions often overlap a number of different clinical specialties, students will encounter many of the 100 medical conditions elsewhere in their clinical training.  Revisiting curricular material during their placement in Medicine and Related Specialties allows for `vertical integration¿ with students being able to elaborate on their earlier learning.    The clinical placement in Medicine & related Specialities occurs in Year 4 during which students will undergo 9 weeks of clinical training which will focus on General Medicine. A further 9 weeks will focus on Sub-specialty Medicine. During this 9 week period students will rotate through a block of sub-specialties:  General Medicine (`core¿ educational opportunities) Respiratory  Cardiology Geriatrics  Renal   Endocrine Neurology Rheumatology Dermatology Infectious disease  Sub-specialty Medical Rotations (`core¿ educational opportunities): Block 1: Haematology, Nephrology, Dermatology Block 2: Palliative Care, Rheumatology, Infectious Disease	 Block 3: Oncology, Respiratoy, Neurology  Each block includes a) a specialty with ¿end of life¿ & cancer focus, b) Specialty with significant general component and c) a highly specialised area.  Sub-specialty Medicine will also consist of `elective¿ educational opportunities: Acute Medical Assessment Unit Endoscopy suite (GI & Bronchoscopy) Interventional & non- interventional Cardiology Dialysis unit Dermatology clinic Ophthalmology clinic Radiology unit (involvement in CT/USS/MRI & interventions)#Autumn#austin.stack@ul.ie
BM4011#CLINICAL AND ANATOMICAL SKILLS 1#This module consists of programmed sessions dealing with communication, patient interaction skills, introductory clinical procedures and history taking in medical practice. Introductory sessions in clinical interviewing and history taking lead progressively to the development of more sophisticated communication skills as the module evolves.  There is also structured teaching in physical examination skills, first aid, resuscitation and in a range of procedural skills.   Laboratory practicals relevant to the basic sciences centre on anatomy teaching, which students learn through surface anatomy on live humans, anatomical models, plastinated anatomical specimens, prosected anatomical specimens and through medical imaging.  Students are not routinely involved in anatomical dissection.#Autumn#
BM4012#CLINICAL AND ANATOMICAL SKILLS 2#This module consists of programmed sessions dealing with communication skills, history-taking in clinical practice, physical examination skills, and clinical procedural skills. It builds on the clinical skills acquisition in Year 1 of the programme (i.e. Clinical Skills 1 - BM4011) such that students develop more sophisticated skills as the programme evolves.  As in Year 1 (BM4011), there is structured teaching in physical examination skills, first aid, resuscitation and in a range of procedural skills.  Teaching is integrated with that in the Knowledge of Health & Illness 2 (BM4002) module that runs simultaneously.#Autumn#
BM4013#OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY#This module is outcome driven in that teaching and learning is directed at the attainment of competence in the diagnosis and mangement of a range of problems commonly encountered in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. There are 21 such conditions and these are provided in the appendix to this module.  For each condition students will develop knowledge of common causes and classifications, incidence and prevalence, pathogenesis and pathophysiology, clinical features and characteristics findings from investigations, differential diagnoses, clinical course, management principles, prognosis and prevention. In the hospital setting students work with medical practitioners and unit teams in both inpatient and outpatient settings for a period of 7 weeks.

BM4014#SURGERY#The Core Curriculum in Surgery is `outcome focused¿, being centred on 69 clinical conditions relevant to surgery that all students must be able to manage by the time of their graduation (see Appendix E).  This list of conditions has been derived from two related 2003 publications: Objectives for the Qualifying Examination produced by the Medical Council of Canada and Anthology of Medical Conditions produced by the Australian Medical Council.  There are a number of specific objectives for each of these 69 clinical surgical conditions and these span items of knowledge, clinical skills and attitudes.    As clinical conditions often overlap a number of different clinical specialties, students will encounter many of the 69 surgical conditions elsewhere in their clinical training.  Revisiting curricular material during their placement in Surgery & Related Specialties allows for `vertical integration¿ with students being able to elaborate on their earlier learning.  Thus, for example, a student might have encountered one or more patients with an arthritic hip (Clinical Condition 089G) during their Primary Care/General Practice placement in Year 3 at which time they might have focused on diagnosis and on the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis.  When they again encounter patients with arthritic hips during their placement in Surgery & Related Specialties, they might first revise their prior learning and then focus on the pre-operative, peri-operative and post-operative management of patients undergoing hip surgery.  The clinical placement in Surgery & Related Specialties occurs in Year 4 and is of 18 week¿s duration During which students will undergo 9 weeks of clinical training which will focus on General Surgery and on providing a depth of clinical experience. A further 9 weeks of clinical training will focus on Sub-specialty Surgery and on providing a breadth of clinical experience. Sub-specialty Surgery will consist of both `core¿ and `elective¿ educational opportunities. General Surgery (`core¿ educational opportunities) Breast & Endocrine Surgery Upper & Lower Gastrointestinal Surgery Hepatobiliary/Pancreatic Surgery Vascular Surgery  Sub specialty Surgery  (`core¿ educational opportunities) Breast Surgery Colorectal Surgery Vascular Surgery Peri-Operative Medicine/Anaesthetics  Sub specialty Surgery  (`elective¿ educational opportunities) Colorectal & General Surgery Breast & Endocrine Surgery Vascular Surgery Peri-operative Medicine Urology Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery Head & Neck Surgery (ENT & MaxFax) Ophthalmology#Autumn#Stewart.Walsh@ul.ie

The latter consists of a compulsory six week period of study that will provide students with the opportunity to undertake a research project. This project will relate to an area of Medicine or Surgery or indeed to any other clinical discipline (e.g. General Practice, Obstetrics/Gynaecology, Paediatrics, Psychiatry, Anaesthetics, Radiology, Pathology, etc. etc.). The SSM can be undertaken at the clinical sites affiliated to the UL Graduate-Entry Medical School.  Alternatively, they can be taken elsewhere within Ireland or overseas.    As with all SSMs, student will be expected to take a high level of ownership of the modules in deciding on the project that they wish to undertake and in how they might undertake it.  Each student must submit an outline proposal for his or her Year 4 SSM for approval by the medical school in advance.     The Year 4  SSM may fall into one of four broad categories: Category 1. Audit: This type of SSM allows the student to analyse and interpret specific data in a specific areas of interest.  For example, a student might use clinical audit data on the peri-operative use of antibiotics and analyse the extent to which hospital practice adheres to established clinical guidelines.  (Ethical approval is not required for audits unless a research component e.g. a patient survey is included.) Category 2. Structured Review: This type of SSM requires the student to undertake a literature review based in a specific area of interest.  For example, a student might review the literature on the `Molecular Basis of Oesophageal Carcinoma.¿   Category 3. Laboratory Based: With this type of SSM, the student undertakes a laboratory-based study.  For example, a student might perform some laboratory experiments on the effect of endothelin receptor antagonists on vascular smooth muscle.   Category 4. Clinically Based: With this type of SSM, the student undertakes clinical research in a particular field of interest and then analyses the data.   For example, a student might generate original data on the incidence of post-operative wound infection following lower limb amputation at a particular hospital.   Students will be required to produce a written report of their SSM.  This will be summatively assessed and will contribute to the overall grade for Year 4.#Autumn#Paul.Finucane@ul.ie

Audit: This type of SSM allows the student to analyse and interpret specific data in a specific areas of interest.  For example, a student might use clinical audit data on the peri-operative use of antibiotics and analyse the extent to which hospital practice adheres to established clinical guidelines.  (Ethical approval is not required for audits unless a research component e.g. a patient survey is included.)  Category 2. Structured Review: This type of SSM requires the student to undertake a literature review based in a specific area of interest.  For example, a student might review the literature on the Molecular Basis of Oesophageal Carcinoma.  Category 3. Laboratory Based: With this type of SSM, the student undertakes a laboratory-based study.  For example, a student might perform some laboratory experiments on the effect of endothelin receptor antagonists on vascular smooth muscle.   Category 4. Clinically Based: With this type of SSM, the student undertakes clinical research in a particular field of interest and then analyses the data.   For example, a student might generate original data on the incidence of post-operative wound infection following lower limb amputation at a particular hospital.   Students will be required to produce a written report of their SSM.  This will be summatively assessed and will contribute to the overall grade for Year 4.# #James.Ohare@ul.ie

BR4002#BROADENING: ENGLISH AS WE SPEAK IT IN IRELAND#The purpose of this module is to give participants an insight into how language is really used, rather than how we think it is used or how we think it should be used. For many analysts of language, spoken, conversational language is an effective baseline against which to investigate how language is used in distinctive ways in different contexts. We focus on Irish English, the way the English language is spoken in Ireland, and what makes it a distinct, rich and interesting variety of English. The materials used for the module are designed to be engaging, enjoyable and relevant.  The syllabus covers the development of Irish English, its history and present-day characteristics - this will involve learning new terms to talk about spoken language in order to describe it, and so terms such as phonology, syntax, lexis, pragmatics and discourse will be introduced for non-specialists. Many of the concepts critical to understanding and analysing spoken language, such as the concept of the turn, or vagueness in language are very accessible. The syllabus will also include learning about how corpora are used in the contemporary study of spoken and written varieties of language, and hands-on experience of using corpus analysis software to investigate language. Naturally occurring language from everyday sources, such as newspapers and social media will also be used as practical examples of language, as well as fictional representations of Irish English in film, television and literature.# #Elaine.Vaughan@ul.ie

BR4012#BROADENING: COMMUNICATION ACROSS CULTURES#This module aims at developing students' intercultural communication competence. The module will bring the concept of intercultural learning to life in a way that is engaging and allows students to critically evaluate the importance of language in intercultural communication. Students will attend an individual advisory session with a language tutor where they will reflect on their current language level and intercultural awareness; this will allow sudents to identify learning goals and create a programme of learning including telecollaborative tasks in order to achieve these goals.  Students will tkae responsibility for the organisation of their own learning, establish and maintain contact with their partners and seek and offer information and opinions to enable development of intercultural communicative competence. Students will demonstrate in-depth reflection on their learning process through the keeping of a learner diary, in which they will record progress made, plan their next steps and reflect on their development during the semester.# #
BR4021#BROADENING: OUR CITY - OUR UNIVERSITY#The 'Our City' part of the module will introduce students to their native, or adopted, city. For most UL students, knowledge of Limerick is patchy at best - for both native Limerick students and those coming to UL from elsewhere in the country or abroad, it is a chance to refute the often negative perception of the City, to appreciate its buildings and natural resources, to understand the role played by the City at the heart of its region. We would like to introduce a new idea about the city whose future is influenced by its relevant past; the Georgian Grid being one example.  The 'Our University' part of the module will introduce students to the present and possible future role that The University of Limerick can play in Limerick city's future. What is now clear is that Limerick City cannot grow and achieve its potential without a strong and thriving relationship with the University of Limerick, while at the same time the strategic vision of Limerick City cannot develop without strong Strategic support from the University.  The following units form the syllabus for the module: Histories of Limerick City; the City Economy; Limerick City and Region: Improving Environmental Sustainability; International Trends in the Interactions Between Town and Gown Over the Centuries; The University Economy; The City Economy; Future Strategies/Histories of the University; The Georgian Grid of Newtown Pery Limerick; Future Strategies/Histories; Re-imagining the University; Skills & Competencies to Work Pragmatically and Swiftly.# #
BR4031#BROADENING BY UNDERSTANDING AND CONFRONTING CRISIS AND RISK#Risk and crises are powerful forces that affect and shape human behavior, and society, defining the lives of people and institutions in the 21st century.   Crisis is risk realised, and both are central factors affecting decision making.  Students will understand the magnitude of risk and crisis within society, and how it transcends multiple contexts, and disciplines, analysing the topic from several different perspectives.    Students will gain knowledge of how individuals and organizations quantify and perceive risk, broadening their understanding of risk and crisis portrayal from a physiological, historical, economic, scientific, and communications perspective.  The module comprises of six learning units; Risk in Society; Historical Perspectives of Risk & Crisis; Economic Perspectives of Risk & Crisis; The Neurobiology of Risk; Portrayal of Risk & Crisis in the Media; Risk and Crisis Communications.  This module brings together insights from the fields of business, economics, communications, history, journalism, and medicine.# #Conor.Carroll@ul.ie
BR4041#BROADENING: SOCIAL MEDIA FOR SOCIAL GOOD#The 'Social Media for Social Good' module allows students to develop both practical skills and a good theoretical grounding in the relevant fields. Students will gain a grounding in stakeholder theory, business ethics, corporate social responsibility and social entrepreneurship. They will learn practical skills in the application of social media, as well as their sociological and psychological contexts. They will engage with a social entrepreneur or community/voluntary group external to the university, and working in groups, apply what they have learned to develop for them a social media strategy.   The module is suitable for first and second year students from all disciplines and courses. Note, however, that in the first pilot year intake will be restricted to first year students only.# #John.lannon@ul.ie

BR4081#BROADENING: ACTIVE BODY, ACTIVE MIND#Students will be provided with content and opportunities that allow them to engage in physical activity and learning in a fun, creative, challenging and social context. Through the introduction of different physical activities using the UL campus environment (e.g., team challenges, orienteering, walking, aquatics, sports, dance) students will become aware of the common currency of physical activity not only from a group perspective but also with respect to the level of autonomy individuals have in determining their own active lifestyles. The module provides students with an opportunity learn from an interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary perspectives how to make decisions from a collective group perspective as regards the determinants of being physically active and also accomodate space for students to identify their own motives/ motivational climate in considering and maintaining an active lifestyle. Behavioural change models (e.g., the transtheoretical model/ stages of change model) provide the framework for students to conceptualise and measure active lifestyles of the student population as well as their own. Additionally, this framework can facilitate promotion strategies for individuals and groups. Attention will also be given to the environment in which activity occurs focusing on aspects of contextual intelligence. In addition to enhancing their physical health, the module will also challenge students to become critically aware of their learning styles, their personal study habits and the link between physical activity and improved motivation and learning success.# #Mark.Campbell@ul.ie

CS6192#STRATEGIC ISSUES IN HEALTH INFORMATICS#Health care managers need to understand evaluation mechanisms to determine whether to purchase or build systems. Also, when the purchase option is selected, they must decide whether to procure fully integrated turnkey solutions or individual best-of-breed packages to be integrated by the facility. A major strategic issue in healthcare settings is how best to support the concept of the Learning Organisation. Health care professionals need to appreciate how strategic information systems will be used to address this need. As well as the selection of information systems acquisitions or development projects, managers and other health care professionals must address the issue of new system implementation and how best to deal with change within the health care facility.

CU4006#TRAVEL LITERATURE#This module will cover the genre of travel literature, giving a background to the origins and following developments up to the present day and by examining different forms of travel literature.  After an introduction to the history of travel literature, utopian literature as well as colonial representation of the æNew WorldÆ will be examined in the period dating from the late fifteenth century through to the final decades of the seventeenth century. Comparing and contrasting the representations of America found in the reports of the earliest Spanish explorers with that found in later Puritan accounts, this element of the course will analyze the European æinventionÆ of America as a pre-lapsarian utopia. The main part of the module will then concentrate on Ireland as a travel destination, seen from an outsiderÆs perspective through the eyes of European visitors from the Middle Ages up to the twentieth century and compared with travel accounts of Irish writers. Questions of identity, cross-cultural awareness and language as a communication tool will be analyzed.#Spring#Gisela.Holfter@ul.ie
CU4007#POPULAR GENRES AND POSTMODERNISM#The various forms of popular genres and the functions attributed over time to the category of the popular will be explored through an examination of the genesis and development of a range of genres such as the detective novel, science fiction, horror, romance, comics etc.. Theoretical positions with regard to hierarchical taste formations and the shifts in the critical debate on popular culture will be presented and discussed, in particular in the context of postmodernist theory. A central issue will be how popular genres articulate socio-cultural values and to what extent they reinforce ideological stances on, among others, gender, class, ethnicity. The course will focus on an in-depth analysis of a number of literary (and cinematographic) works from different cultural and national backgrounds. These will include reworkings of genres such as the detective novel and science fiction in international postmodernist literature.#Autumn#Niamh.Hehir@ul.ie
CU4008#POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURES#Considering that approximately three-quarters of the worldÆs population has been in some way affected by colonialism, postcolonial texts from various parts of the world share some characteristics but they are also distinct due to their different socio-cultural and linguistic contexts. This module will examine these commonalities and differences through lectures and seminars based on a selection of texts covering various literary genres: poetry, short story, theatre and novel. Texts will be selected from different cultural and linguistic traditions such as Canada, South America, the Caribbean, the Maghreb, South Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, to reflect the wide-reaching effects of colonialism as well as to encourage a comparative approach to literature. It will also be of particular relevance to study IrelandÆs postcolonial literature given that most students will presumably be Irish but also because it is a unique example of a European country having experienced colonialism. In light of the variety of works falling under the ôpostcolonialöcategory, it will be essential to consider the different theories and concepts pertaining to postcolonial literature, such as ônegritudeö (ôblacknessö), hybridity, creolisation, the centre vs. the periphery, linguistic issues as well as feminist topics related to postcolonialism. All works will be studied in translation.#Spring#Frederic.Royall@ul.ie

The experience of migrants which adds to the complexity of the issue of cultural identity and highlights the multi-cultural nature of contemporary European societies while questioning traditional concepts of national identity will also be studied. The issues and ideas are approached though the media of literary texts, film, visual art, music etc. in order to ascertain the particular contribution and perspective of such texts within this debate. The approach will be through case studies which will include the discussion of texts from countries such as Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. These case studies will form the basis for a comparative analysis with a view of defining the similarities and dissimilarities in debates about cultural identity in contemporary European cultures. The question of emerging European cultural identities will also be discussed.#Spring#Barbara.Geraghty@ul.ie

The work of authors such as Saussure and Sapir and Whorf is examined and its relevance to power, ideology and later developments in sociolinguistics is highlighted. These themes are further developed through discussion of the interaction of language with social variables of key importance to the course overall, such as identity, gender, age and ethnicity. Attention is also paid to crucial sites such as the media and public organisations and issues of language planning and policy are addressed with reference to notions such as standardisation, authority, cultural dominance and capital, conflict and accommodation. This will entail exploration of the concepts of standard and dialectal Englishes, including that of Hiberno-English. Issues in translation theory, with reference to aspects such as culture, gender and identity will also be used to exemplify further some of the issues dealt with.#Autumn#Nuria.Borrull@ul.ie
CU6012#UTOPIAN THEORY AND TEXTS#Utopianism, social dreaming, can be both a fundamental component and a critical way of understanding and changing the complex totality of economic, cultural, political, and social life. As it projects or interprets social values and practices that are better than the status quo, a utopian vision or method can be a dynamic, sometimes dangerous, tool in the processes of cultural creation and socio-political change.  The module aims to develop an advanced understanding of the nature and form(s) of Utopia and the utopian method; to develop an advanced understanding of the function of Utopia and utopian theory, thought, expression, and practice in the processes of social critique and development; and to engage critically with utopian theory, thought, expression, and practice in the form of a seminar presentation and a researched essay.#Autumn#Joachim.Fischer@ul.ie

Advertising is not only the dominant discourse of capitalism, but also an omnipresent source of texts in the everyday lives. This part of the syllabus places advertising in its historical, economic, social, linguistic and cultural context, and involves a presentation of the many ways in which advertisements can be analysed. Tourism will be studied as a particular case.  3. Cultures of resistance: In this section, the phenomenon of counter-market cultures, and cultures that suggest alternatives to free market capitalism (e.g. fair trade, anti-globalization) is presented and explored.#Autumn#

CU6031#COMPARATIVE LITERATURE: CULTURAL CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE PAST#The re-assessment, reworking and re-imagining of the past is an essential part of contemporary cultural production as it is closely related to postmodern ideology and to the reconfiguration of collective narratives. This module will explore such issues from an international comparative perspective. After an introduction on methodologies in and theoretical approaches to comparative literature, it will focus on the relationship between history and representation through the exploration of subaltern collective memory and the role of textual and filmic re-writings of history. The module focuses on the cultural representation of the recent past in Austria, Germany and Spain. Within this, it pays especial attention to the European experiences of National Socialism and World War II, the Spanish Civil War and the Francoist Dictatorship. The core aspect of this module will be the study of the subjective re-writing of history through fiction, both textual and filmic, and its effect/impact on the formation of subaltern and alternative narratives of the past.#Autumn#Marieke.Krajenbrink@ul.ie
CU6032#THESIS WRITING: LANGUAGE, LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES#The module will prepare students for the main stages of writing the thesis, focusing in particular on aspects such as the following:   Preparing a proposal, chapter-by-chapter outline and work plan;   Becoming familiar with the conventions of writing appropriate to the academic context in which they are working. Conventions of three types will be examined:  Structural: conventions for aspects of the thesis such as the abstract, general introduction and conclusion, introductions and conclusions to chapters, types of paragraph structure, appendices;  Stylistic: argumentative devices such as hedging, boosting, authorial stance, strong and weak referencing;  Presentational: applying a style guide, referencing, punctuation, consistency in spelling, proofreading.   Mastering the use of these conventions to develop the argument of the thesis and their own writing style;  Avoiding plagiarism;  Becoming aware of their own writing processes and developing strategies to maximise these;  Realising to what extent writing the thesis is a transferable skill which will be applicable to writing activities in their future careers.# #Carrie.Griffin@ul.ie
CU6041#LITERATURE OF MIGRATION#This module explores literary representations of migration, diaspora and exile with emphasis on the Irish experience of emigration as well as immigration in the context of other experiences of migrancy and dislocation in Europe and around the world. Issues and topics that occur in the context of forced and voluntary migrations have resulted in a range of creative expressions in literature and other artistic forms. The reassessment, reworking and reimagining of the past and present forms of migration, diaspora and exile is an essential part of contemporary cultural production as it is closely related to questions of identity, ethnicity, history, memory, language and home. All of these themes which have developed a strong resonance in life and literature in the 20th and 21st century will form the background of analysis of the chosen texts.# #

It covers recent demographic and labour market trends as well as distributional issues including poverty and income distribution. It proceeds to cover the policy and performance of the agriculture, services and manufacturing sectors. This is followed by the conduct of supply side policies such as competition and regulation policy. The course also covers the issues arising from the increased integration of emerging economies such as China as well as developing economies and the challenges posed by their development in terms of different aspects of sustainability including environment, trade and labour market issues.#Autumn#
EC4002#History of Economic Thought#The module begins with a discussion of the contribution of the ancient Greeks to the development of modern economic thought. This is followed by an evaluation of the ideas of St. Thomas Aquinas from the middle ages. Next the contribution of the mercantilists is assessed, especially with respect to their input to international trade policy.  Then the contribution of the Physiocratic  school is analysed with particular emphasis the concept of ælaissez faireÆ economics. The substantial contribution of Adam Smith as the æfatherÆ of modern economics is addressed in detail. This is followed by an appraisal of the contribution of the classical school of thought, with a focus on the works of David Ricardo and Robert Malthus. The writings of Karl Marx and the Marxist school of thought as an alternative to the market system is reviewed and debated. The Neo-Classical School of thought, especially the contribution of  William S. Jevons, Leon Walras and Karl Menger are analysed. The module concludes with an analysis of the contribution of Keynes to the development of modern economic thought as well as an analysis of the most recent contributions to  modern economic thought.#Spring#

EC4004#ECONOMICS FOR BUSINESS#Section one of the module is concerned with the macroeconomy. The topics covered include:  the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity and the Fisher effect.  These theories are combined to obtain what is known as the "open economy monetary model".  This model is then used to evaluate particular issues including the long-run performance of the Irish economy and the factors underlying the 'Celtic Tiger' period. The module continues by extending the analysis of production and cost theory developed in first year microeconomics.  Imperfect market structures of the firm are explored including analysis of game theory. Labour market decisions are analysed with respect to the supply and demand for labour and wage determination, the latter forms the key link between the micro and macro sections of the module.  An overview of the theoretical and practical exposition of business objectives along with key issues facing the firm in the business environment in addition to the role of government are then explored.#Autumn#Donal.Palcic@ul.ie

EC4013#MICROECONOMICS#The question of what is economics is explored. In answering this question emphasis is placed on the importance of key concepts such as scarcity, individual decision-making, trade-offs and opportunity cost. Students are also introduced to the distinctions between microeconomics vs macroeconomics and normative vs positive economics. Markets as a means of organising economic activity are examined. The model of supply and demand is used to understand how market equilibrium prices and quantities are determined. You not only learn how equilibrium is determined, but how relative prices are used by consumers and suppliers to make decisions about the use of society¿s scarce resources. Supply and demand curves are used to explain the movements of prices and the allocation of resources in a market economy such as ours. The sensitivity of demand and supply to changes in key variables such as price and income is analysed through measures and discussions of elasticity which is briefly introduced. Individual decisions are examined to show how they come together to form the demand curve. Consumer choice using indifference curve analysis is introduced. Shifting the focus back to the market process the latter part of the module focuses its attention on supply and costs of production. Students examine the different types of costs and how costs affect revenue and profits. Cost concepts and how they relate to a perfectly competitive firm¿s supply decision are examined. At the other end of the competitive spectrum is the complete absence of market competition. This situation of monopoly (single priced vs price discrimination monopolists) is also studied Syllabus: What is economics; scarcity; individual decision-making; trade-offs and opportunity cost; microeconomics vs macroeconomics; normative vs positive economics; markets; model of demand and supply; market equilibrium and disequilibrium; scarce resources; elasticity; consumer choice theory using indifference curves and budget constraints; costs of production; revenue; profits; market structures; perfect competition; monopoly (single priced vs price discrimination monopolists).# #Helena.Lenihan@ul.ie

EC4016#Public Finance#The module begins with an examination of how an efficient market should function using General Equilibrium Analysis to describe the concept of Pareto efficiency. Using this concept as a benchmark, the course then moves on to examine various ways in which actual markets fail and demonstrates why these lead to inefficiencies in the allocation of resources. The role of governments in correcting market failures through regulation and the disbursement of public monies is then examined. Finally, the module examines the impact of government interventions on market efficiency. The impact of commodity taxes on market allocation of resources is first examined, followed by a description of how labour taxes affect incentives to work.#Spring#Donal.Palcic@ul.ie

EC4024#FINANCIAL ECONOMICS#We will begin with data. First, we'll describe the categories within which financially important variables exist, and develop ways to encapsulate them using simple statistics drawn from the study of simple probability distributions.  We will develop graphical tools to analyse market movements in the lectures. Then we will move on to the study of financial history, to show the influence of uncertainty and 'Black Swans' on the markets, and to help you understand just how little we as economists really know about the markets and how they move. We will develop three simple but flawed models used to benchmark markets to round out the course, which every person interested in finance must know, as these models begin many of the conversations one might have about a stock or a bond. Then we will pull these models apart, so students will know more than most leaving a course like this at the undergraduate level.#Spring#Stephen.Kinsella@ul.ie

The model of supply and demand is used to understand how market equilibrium prices and quantities are determined.  You not only learn how equilibrium is determined, but how relative prices are used by consumers and suppliers to make decisions about the use of societys scarce resources.  Supply and demand curves are used to explain the movements of prices and the allocation of resources in a market economy such as ours.  Government intervention in the market via the introduction of price ceilings (maximum price) and price floors (minimum price) are also examined. The sensitivity of demand and supply to changes in key variables such as price and income is analysed through measures of elasticity. Individual decisions are looked at in detail to show how they come together to form the demand curve.  Consumer choice using indifference curve analysis is introduced.

EC4911#MICROECONOMICS#What is economics is explored.  Concepts such as scarcity, individual decision-making, trade-offs and opportunity cost along with distinctions between microeconomics vs macroeconomics and normative vs positive economics are emphasised.  Markets are examined.  The model of supply and demand is used to understand how market equilibrium prices and quantities are determined. Intervention in the market via price ceilings and price floors are also examined.  The sensitivity of demand and supply to changes in key variables such as price and income is analysed through elasticity.  Consumer choice using indifference curve analysis is presented.  The latter part of the module focuses its attention on supply and costs of production.  The different ¿types of costs¿ and how costs affect revenue and profits are examined.  A perfectly competitive firms supply decision along with that of  Monopoly  (single priced vs price discrimination monopolists) are also studied.# #Helena.Lenihan@ul.ie
EC4913#ECONOMICS FOR BUSINESS#The module begins by extending the analysis of production and cost theory developed in first year microeconomics.  Imperfect market structures of the firm are explored including analysis of game theory.

An overview of the theoretical and practical exposition of business objectives along with key issues facing the firm in the business environment in addition to the role of government are then explored.  Section two of the module is concerned with the macroeconomy. The topics covered include:  the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity and the Fisher effect.  These theories are combined to obtain what is known as the ¿open economy monetary model¿.  This model is then used to evaluate particular issues including the long-run performance of the Irish economy and the factors underlying the ¿Celtic Tiger¿ period.# #Stephen.Kinsella@ul.ie

The module then progresses towards examining the underlying microeconomic theory of small firm behaviour.  The macro economic environment in which the small firm operates is also examined. The ôeconomic way of thinkingö introduced in the module involves the use of key concepts and models to help the student to begin to understand the complex real world economy in which the small firm operates. Focus is then placed on clarifying the contribution of entrepreneurship to economic activity thus enabling students to understand the role and functions of small firms. Concepts such as networking, innovation and technology policy are discussed from an economic/industrial policy perspective.  The module concludes by focussing on the industrial policy environment in which the small firm operates whilst also examining the rationale for government intervention with respect to small firm activity.  Finally, the issues relating to the economic evaluation of small firm public policy interventions are examined.#Spring#Helena.Lenihan@ul.ie

EH4001#CRITICAL PRACTICE 1: ACADEMIC READING AND WRITING#Intended as a foundational course for students moving from second to third level models of studying literature(s) in English, students will be introduced to the basic skills necessary to develop critical readings of literary texts. Literary genres will be addressed within the module with primary texts drawn from British and American prose fiction. Basic elements of literary theory will also be introduced.#Autumn#
EH4002#CRITICAL PRACTICE 2 - RENAISSANCE LITERATURE#This module introduces students to genre-based studies in poetry and drama, in this case, to significant ideas and key works from the English Renaissance. The period studied, from the Reformation to the Restoration, sees the introduction into England both of new philosophies, such as humanism, and new literary forms, such as the sonnet. Therefore, the module aims to place the literature in those cultural, social, and political contexts which inform and affect its interpretation, and, through an account of the poetic and dramatic developments of the period, to equip students with the skills to identify and critically analyse poetic forms and dramatic conventions.#Spring#Carrie.Griffin@ul.ie
EH4003#INTRODUCTION TO LITERARY THEORY#The module provides an introduction to literary theory, incorporating modes of analysis which emphasise the relationships of literature to issues of race, class, and gender. Though theory will be introduced historically, twentieth century literary theory will make up the core of the module. Students are encouraged to compare and contrast the various models of literary discussion presented during the course, and to think about how the following models might be applied to texts: Russian Formalism;  'new' criticism; reader-response criticism; psychoanalytic criticism; Marxist criticism; structuralism, post-structuralism, feminism, deconstruction, cultural materialism, new historicism, queer theory and post-colonialism.#Autumn#
EH4006#VICTORIAN TEXTS AND CONTEXTS#Addressing developments in literary practice and form, we will focus initially on the rise of the novel, and will also consider changes in the nature of author and audience during the second half of the nineteenth century. Nineteenth century aesthetic, political and social contexts for the literature will be central to our work and a range of theoretical approaches will be tested in relation to these categories. As part of this endeavour, students taking the module will be asked to participate in a group-based research project.# #
EH4007#LITERARY MODERNISM#This module covers British literature from 1900-1945. Writers will include major novelists of the period such as E.M. Forster, D.H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce; and/or major poets such as T.S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, W.H. Auden and the poets of the First World War. In defining the themes and interpreting the literature of the period, attention is paid to political, social and cultural constructs (for example, the World Wars, the suffrage movement, the impact of other art forms), to significant concepts and philosophies (for example, Primitivism, psychoanalysis, physics) and to literary movements (for example, Bloomsbury).# #Margaret.Harper@ul.ie
EH4008#BRITISH LITERATURE SINCE 1945#This module covers British literature from 1945-present. Writers will include major novelists of the period such as Jean Rhys, Doris Lessing, Margaret Drabble, A. S. Byatt, Salman Rushdie, Jeanette Winterson, Kazuo Ishiguro and Zadie Smith; poets such as Philip Larkin, Dylan Thomas, Derek Walcott, Geoffrey Hill and ted Hughes; and playwrights such as John Osborne, Joe Orton, Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Caryl Churchill and Sarah Kane. To define the themes and interpret this literature, students will become familiar with political, social and historical contexts (the Second World War, various liberation movements, the rise and fall of the welfare state), with significant concepts and philosophies (Thatcherism, postmodernism), and with literary movements (Angry Young Men, Kitchen Sink Realism, New Brutalists)# #
EH4012#RESTORATION AND AUGUSTAN LITERATURE#This module aims to provide students with a survey of the English literature of the period variously known as the Augustan Age, the long eighteenth century, and the Enlightenment in Britain and Ireland. Informing students of the various critical and historical methodologies which can be applied to later seventeenth and eighteenth-century writing, we will study changes in literary practice and form alongside changes in the nature of author and audience, paying close attention to the broad cultural transition in which the cynical, satirical, and sometimes highly sexualised literature of the Restoration period (1660-c1700) yielded to the gentler pastoral sensibilities of the middle of the eighteenth century. Along the way we will study utopian, libertarian and feminist impulses at work in the literature and thought of the Restoration and Augustan periods; we will also place these works in their global context, appreciating that this literature was produced on the cusp of the first substantial phase of BritainÆs imperial expansion. The social history, philosophy, and literary forms of the period will be examined through a close study of selected texts.#Spring#
EH4013#SENSIBILITY AND ROMANTICISM#Inspired and subsequently alarmed by French and American revolutions, the writers of this period grappled with issues of race, slavery, gender, democracy, and republicanism. The module will begin with examples of the anxious introspection which characterises the poetry of sensibility; from this point forward is traced a shift from a negative and trivialising concept of æthe romanticÆ towards the more complex Romantic cults of Nature and Imagination.#Autumn#
EH4016#STATE OF THE UNION: AMERICAN LITERATURE SINCE 1890#This module covers American fiction, poetry and drama from 1890 to the present day, including works by, for example, Chopin, Wharton, Crane, Stein, Frost, Stevens, Pound, Eliot, O Neill, Cummings, Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Hemingway, Welty, Williams, Salinger, Kerouac, Heller, O Connor, Ginsberg, Plath, DeLillo, and Pynchon; African-American writing by Du Bois, Hurston, Hughes, Wright, Ellison, Baldwin, Morrison and Baraka; Asian-American writing by Mukherjee, Tan and Lahiri; Jewish-American writing by Singer, Malamud, Bellow, Miller, and Roth; Native American writing by Silko and Erdrich; literature after 9/11. In defining the themes and interpreting the literature of the period, attention is paid to political, social and cultural contexts (for example, the Great Depression, the World Wards, the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War), to significant concepts and philosophies (for example, realism, naturalism, modernism, postmodernism), and to literary movements (for example, regional writing, the Lost Generation, the Harlem Renaissance, the Beat Generation).# #
EH4017#CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN LITERATURE IN ENGLISH#This module will examine the literary representation of violence by authors writing across the African continent today.  Specifically, our analyses of selected works and writers will explore the following themes: 1. how attempts toward the national catharsis of post-genocide Rwanda and post-apartheid South Africa have been unsuccessful in ridding the two countries of cruelty and bloodshed; 2. how child soldiers come to terms with their violent and violated childhood while struggling to reinvent themselves in the midst of ruined societies; 3. how anti-colonial liberation warfare is remembered and informs contemporary identity struggles; and 4. how the memory of slavery informs the desire for rootedness and home.  We will read novels, autobiographies, and hybrid texts, alongside watching films and reviewing key essays in the field of African literature.# #Yianna.Liatsos@ul.ie
EH4018#CONTEMPORARY IRISH LITERATURE#The period since 1980 has seen profound changes throughout the island of Ireland, particularly in the post-Robinson period. Drawing on the work of writers north and south, as well as those working within both the diaspora and immigrant communities in Ireland, students will consider how these texts have constructed and deconstructed the cultural, social and political landscape of contemporary Ireland.# #
EH4023#THE NEW WORLD: AMERICAN LITERATURE TO 1890#American literature pre-1620 (for examples, Columbus, de Vaca, Harriot, Smith): American literature from 1620 to the early 18th century (for example, Bradford, Bradstreet, Rowlandson, Byrd); the Puritan influence (for example, Williams, Taylor, Mather, Edwards); the Age of Enlightenment and Revolution 1750-1820 (for example, Paine, Jefferson, The Federalist, Murray); 19th century American literature (for example, Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, Whitman, Melville, Dickinson); incipient American modernism.# #
EH4026#COLONIAL/POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURE IN ENGLISH#This module will examine colonial discourse of the British Empire, through a series of colonial and postcolonial literary and theoretical readings. More specifically, we will review the fundamental dichotomies of colonial discourse - master/ slave, center/margins, enlightenment/barbarism, authenticity/ hybridity, secular modernity/ religious conservatism, nation/nativism - and will proceed to read articles and novels from the end of the 19th century, as well as 20th century, from India, Africa and the Caribbean, that both address and attempt to reconfigure the colonial experience from a variety of perspectives.# #Yianna.Liatsos@ul.ie
EH4027#CONTEMPORARY WOMEN'S WRITING#This course will introduce students to a number of key fictions by British and North American women authors, written between the 1970s and the present day. We will examine the ways in which these fictions respond to the changes in female experience in the second half of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first century, as well as exploring how these fictions reflect upon, and re-figure, conventional understandings of gender identity. Key issues for discussion will be the ways in which the texts respond to their social and cultural contexts, and how gender identity is shaped by location and place in these fictions. We will also explore the significant motifs that emerge across texts, such as women and madness; mother-daughter relationships; femininity and desire; fantasy and romance; the body; and the writing of race and gender.# #Sinead.Mcdermott@ul.ie
EH4028#STUDY OF A MAJOR IRISH AUTHOR#This module will function as a critical survey of the work of a major Irish author. Students will study the authors development from early efforts to mature output and will analyse and discuss the authors overall impact on literary history. The module will position the author historically and politically, considering the authors role as a contributor to intellectual history. By locating the author in different theoretical and methodological frameworks, students will have the opportunity to assess and interpret a wide range of the authors work.    Example One - James Joyce  Addressing the production of Irish cultural and social identities in these texts, students will construct readings of Joyces work using contemporary literary and cultural theory. Focusing on the major fictions of Joyce, the module will also consider his prose and life-writing, and explore the interconnections between these various writings. Joyces literary experimentation provides an opportunity to explore narrative form and technique and so the module will consider the ways in which literary conventions and cultural discourses are challenged in his work. Given the range of new media available in this field as well as Joyces own commitment to film, we will explore a number of methods of reading Joyce from photographs, to archive footage, to the contemporary documentaries about and film productions of his work, to the Joyce hypertext and other online resources.# #
EH4033#AFTER THE REVIVAL: STUDIES IN MODERN IRISH POETRY#Beginning with an assessment of the influence of the poetry of WB Yeats and anticipating the influence of the wider literary revival, the course will move chronologically forward to study the works of major poets such as Denis Devlin, Austin Clarke, Patrick Kavanagh, Thomas Kinsella, Seasmus Heaney, Michael Hartnett, Eavan Boland, Paula Meehan and Medbh McGuckian. The course will consider matters such as the poets relationship to the nation and to the State; and will  also measure the significance of landscape, memory, myth and gender in the corpus of twentieth-century and contemporary Irish poetry in English.# #
EH4036#IRISH LITERATURE 1930 - 1990#The module will introduce students to a range of twentieth-century Irish literary work, focusing on literary realism, avant garde experimentation, autobiography and memoir, radio writing, and film adaptation, to give just some examples. Topics covered may include urban/rural representations, the "Irish city" (which will include transnational examples), "the Troubles" in Irish culture, changing gender representations, sexualities, language questions, migration, and the representation of minority communities in the culture.  While the main focus will be on literary material, the module will also consider the broadcast media and film work of some authors involved, such as Kate O'Brien and Sam Hanna Bell, to give two well-known examples.# #
EH4037#INTRODUCTION TO CREATIVE WRITING#Ireland has a long and well established tradition of excellence in the genre of short story, theatrical, creative non-fiction and poetry writing. This creative writing module draws on that tradition and offers students an opportunity to develop their skills in creative writing in these four genres. Students will benefit from lectures and workshops in which they will learn about the practices of other writers, and from thence explore strategies for effective writing. Students will participate in regular writing activities, working collectively and individually to complete a piece of work in their chosen genre.# #Iva.Yates@ul.ie
EH4038#STUDY OF A MAJOR AUTHOR#This module will function as a critical survey of the work of a major author.  Students will study the authors development from early efforts to mature output and will be able to analyze and discuss the authors overall impact on literary history.  Students will be able to position the author historically and politically and will understand the authors role as a contributor to intellectual history.  Students will be able to position the author in different theoretical and methodological frameworks and will be able to assess and interpret a wide range of the authors work  Example One:  Virginia Woolf  This module will trace the development of the modernist novelist Virginia Woolf from early work to mature output. Students will read most of her major fictions as well as a selection of her essays and autobiographical pieces. Students will study Woolf as a theorist and practitioner of modernist narrative form, as a woman writer deeply interested in questions of female creativity and a significant contributor to feminist literary theory, and as a figure increasingly relevant to studies of memory and trauma. Students will also consider Woolf as a cultural icon by considering her work in relation to recent films and novels that deploy her work and life.# #
EH4043#IRISH LITERARY REVOLUTIONS 1880 - 1930#Exploring selected Irish writers and literary movements 1880-1930, this module aims to introduce learners to one of the most radical periods in Irish culture. Attending to formal and cultural experimentation, and drawing on a range of literary genres, the module will explore the local and transnational dynamics of the Irish literary world. By developing a "thick description" of the period, the module aims to enable students to become better critical thinkers and literary researchers by focusing on close reading, on comparative studies of different writers and (sometimes intersecting) literary movements, and on the reception and critical analysis of this material at the time and since.# #
EH4053#AUGUSTAN AND ROMANTIC LITERATURE#The aim of this course is to provide students with a survey of literature in English between the Restoration of the British monarchy in 1660 through to the democratic reforms of 1830. This course aims to immerse students in the literary language of the time across several genres. We will first look at contexts for the emergence of modern genres such as the polemical pamphlet, the novel, and the journalistic essay. In this first part of the course is studied the prose and poetic writings of figures such as Aphra Behn, Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, Mary Wortley Montagu, and Oliver Goldsmith.  In its second half this module provides students with a survey of literature of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, a period in which literature was involved with, and inspired by, revolutionary political activity. The writers of this period grappled with issues of race, slavery, gender, democracy, and republicanism. We will trace a shift from a negative and trivialising concept of 'the romantic' towards the more complex Romantic cults of Nature and Imagination, thought through in the context of intense friendships and collaboration between clusters of poets and critics. We will survey the writings Robert Burns, Williams Blake, William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Jane Austen, Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley, among others.# #

In doing this, students are introduced to the basic concepts of Post-Colonial Studies and Hiberno-English and the ways in which they are used to critique Irish literature.#Autumn#
EH4116#CONTEMPORARY IRISH WRITING IN ENGLISH#The literary texts are read in ways that relate them to discourses surrounding the articulation of diverse modes of identity in contemporary Ireland. Thematically this module looks at areas such as the Northern Irish æTroublesÆ, the erosion of the dominant Catholic consensus in the Republic, and the increased attention given to womenÆs writing and experience. In order to do this, the literary texts are supplemented by texts that have engaged in the cultural, political and historiographical debates of this period.#Spring#
EH4118#LITERARY THEORY# # #
EH4121#GOTHIC LITERATURE IN IRELAND#This module will introduce students to a chronological progression of texts intended to provide a detailed picture of the emergence of the literary gothic in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Ireland, Britain, and Europe.Assessing a mixture of poetry, prose, and drama, students will come to appreciate the multi-generic nature of the literary gothic as well as the social, cultural, and political contexts in which it was produced. Students will also explore and interrogate the burgeoning area of gothic literary studies, developing, as they do so, a nuanced understanding of both the literature we now describe as 'Gothic' and modern day critical assessments of such literature.# #
EH4125#FEMINIST LITERARY THEORY#This course will combine feminist theory and the analysis of literary texts. We will consider five main areas of feminist theory and criticism: the concept of a 'feminine aesthetic';  the contribution of psychoanalytic theory to understandings of gender, identity and writing; the relationship between æraceÆ, ethnicity and gender in literature; questions of 'gender trouble' and sexuality; and postmodern feminist perspectives as they apply to literary texts. Throughout the course, theoretical approaches will be tested in relation to a range of womenÆs writing. Primary texts will be drawn from English language traditions in the first instance, although writings from other language traditions may be included depending on staff expertise.#Spring#Sinead.Mcdermott@ul.ie
EH4126#IMAGINED SPACES: IRISH CULTURAL TEXTS#The course will introduce students to a range of 20th-21st century Irish fiction and media texts, and address related issues in literary and film theory.  The module aims to deepen students understanding of contemporary Irish culture in the following ways:  1.  By addressing the relationship between contemporary Irish literature/media and the tradition of Irish writing and cultural production; 2.  By providing an overview of the Irish media context with both theoretical and practice-based approaches.  Key issues will include: the myth of the West, urban Ireland, the Troubles in Irish culture, changes in gender roles, questions of language(s), in-migration and diaspora, Irelands Others (e.g. Traveller, minority ethnic, lesbian & gay, and transgender cultures).#Spring#
EH4131#COMPOSITION AND RHETORIC#Intended as a foundation course for students moving from second- to third-level models of learning, this module introduces students to the basic skills of academic writing, analytical thinking and critical reading. Incorporating a large practice-based element, the module enables students to develop skills in close reading critical thinking, information management (using the library, gathering information, evaluating resources and referencing), and writing (including sentence, paragraph and larger structures; stylistic clarity  and mechanics) through a series of lecture/discussions and small-group workshops/labs.# #

EH4158#FROM JAMES JOYCE TO MAEVE BRENNAN: 20TH CENTURY IRISH FICTION#The module will focus primarily on the work of early and mid-twentieth century writers such as Elizabeth Bowen, James Joyce, Seßn OÆFaolßin, Kate OÆBrien, alongside less well-known or 'minor' writers such as the recently rediscovered Maeve Brennan.  Students will engage with the ways in which literary authors handled questions of national and cultural identity in Ireland in the post-independence (or æFree StateÆ) period.  We will then move on to address themes such as: regionalism; censorship; religion; gender and sexuality; autobiography and autobiographical fiction; emigration and diaspora.  Finally, we will discuss the ways in which these issues and themes emerge in the work of later twentieth century writers, and consider contemporary ways of constructing Irish identities within literature.  Note: as this is a final-year module, a background in literary studies and a foundational knowledge of Irish literature will be assumed.#Autumn#
EH4168#MODERN IRISH POETRY: AFTER YEATS#Beginning with the poetry of WB Yeats, which will be considered as foundational, the course will move chronologically forward to include the poetic works of major authors such Denis Devlin, Austin Clarke, Patrick Kavanagh, Thomas Kinsella, Seamus Heaney, Michael Hartnett, Eavan Boland and Medbh McGuckian. Likewise, it is intended to introduce students to less ærenownedÆ poets. To this end, emerging poets such as Nick Laird, Vona Groarke, Leontia Flynn and David Wheatley will also be addressed. In focusing on all of these writers, the course will consider matters such as the poetÆs relationship to the nation and to the state; and the respective roles of landscape, memory, family, history, myth and gender in this variegated body of Irish literature.#Spring#Niamh.Hehir@ul.ie

The output for this course will emerge in the semester following the module as a yearly journal of UL-based writing, hosted by the MA in English. While students on the MA may submit their own creative and critical works, this module is intended to connect graduate studies in English to a broader campus initiative, drawing upon the literary creativity of the broader student community. In providing such a forum, this module will further students¿ applied experience in the examination, assessment and analysis of literary texts. They will develop a sense of the practical difficulties and possibilities involved in the process of editing a literary journal, and in so doing they will add a clear vocational dimension to their literary studies in a collaborative, team-oriented publishing venture.# #Carrie.Griffin@ul.ie
EH6002#RESEARCH METHODS IN LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES#This course will enable first-year postgraduate (MA) students to locate primary resources, including books and manuscripts, and to be able to utilise and assess the qualities of different types of electronic sources which exist in the field of their chosen topic. The module draws upon the expertise of faculty members with diverse research experiences. Seminar discussions and assignments will require students to focus on those resources specific to their individual research plans, and their chosen literary-historical contexts. Educating students in issues surrounding bibliography and editorial processes, this module provides a practical introduction to the materials and the expertise required to conduct original, and ultimately publishable, postgraduate literary research.# #Carrie.Griffin@ul.ie

EH6011#LITERARY MODERNISM#This course examines the political, historical, and cultural contexts that informed modern British literature between 1900 and 1945.  Modernism has conventionally been understood as an artistic movement breaking free of Victorian constraints.  In this view, writers challenged received conventions both in form¿e.g. experiments with plot structure¿and content¿e.g. a new emphasis on subjectivity.  Recently, however, critics have argued for a more expansive understanding of ¿modernism¿ by highlighting the way in which the focus on aesthetics works to marginalize such factors as class affiliation, colonial voices, dissident sexualities, and gender.  Topics will include the two world wars¿ the dissolution of empire; the literary reactions to fascism and the Holocaust; the intellectual impact of Marx, Freud, and others; the suffrage movement; cosmopolitan and international movements such as Dada, Imagism, and Surrealism; modernist literature in relation to other expressions of modernity such as painting and cinema.# #Margaret.Harper@ul.ie
EH6012#POLITICS AND AMERICAN LITERATURE#This module relates American fiction, poetry, and drama to contemporary concerns and debates, drawing on, for example, theories of postcolonialism, multiculturalism, globalisation, Marxism, cultural materialism, new historicism, ecocriticism, gender, psychoanalysis, poststructuralism, and deconstruction. Attention will be paid to political, social, and cultural contexts (for example, the American Revolution, Abolitionism, the Great Depression, the World Wars, the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, 9/11/2001), to significant concepts and philosophies (for example, realism, naturalism, modernism, postmodernism), and to literary movements (for example, Transcendentalism, regional writing, the Lost Generation, the Harlem Renaissance, the Beat Generation, New Journalism).# #
EH6013#DISSERTATION IN CREATIVE WRITING#The dissertation will consist of original creative work that demonstrates the student's mastery of the taught elements of the programme.  The dissertation may consist of one genre--poetry, fiction, nonfiction, drama--or may combine two.  The dissertation strand for each genre is as follows:  30 poems or 30 pages of poetry; 15,000 words of fiction; 15,000 words of nonfiction; one complete script of no more than 90 pages and no fewer than 60.  A multi-genre portfolio of creative work may be submitted, but it may combine only two genres and must consist of 15 poems or pages of poetry, and/or 7500 words of fiction or non-fiction, and/or dramatic writing between 30 and 45 pages in length.# #
EH6021#GENDER AND SEXUALITY IN IRISH WRITING#Questions of gender and sexuality have been at the centre of many controversial ideological debates in Irish society, particularly over the past thirty years. Providing an arena for symbolic meanings, as well as conflicting forces between the self and others, questions of gender and sexuality have been central to the work of many well-known Irish literary writers. This course will introduce students to some of this work, predominantly in the realm of literary and autobiographical writing, and consider the power of representation to address established hierarchies of power in Ireland through the dynamics of gender and sexuality. Key areas of study will include: histories of gender and sexuality; gender, sexuality and nation; writing and the body; Irish masculinities; performativity in Irish literature.# #
EH6022#POT-COLONIAL THEORY AND LITERATURE#This module will function as a critical survey of cultural theories and literary texts that engage postcolonial condition and address political and ethical questions associated with the historical consciousness of postcolonial collective identities; ethnic, religious, political, racial, gendered, and so on. Questions we will be asking in class include the configuration of historical narratives and the issues of representation, truth, accountability, and heritage in South Asia (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka), North and Southern Africa (Algeria, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa), and the Caribbean (Antigua and Jamaica). We will conclude this module by analyzing how postcolonial literature engages discourses associated with the era of globalization, human rights, humanitarian intervention and so on.# #Yianna.Liatsos@ul.ie
EH6031#LITERATURE, FILM AND HUMAN RIGHTS#This module will function as a critical survey of post-World War II human rights discourses as they have been conceived in different narrative contexts and forms, from the United Nations declaration following World War II to the theoretical analysis of torture and war by Elaine Scarry, and from the autobiographical testimony of Nobel-laureate Elie Wiesel to visual and literary productions elucidating specific socio-political and cultural conditions where human rights have been at issue. While this module will begin by offering a general theoretical framework for discussing and understanding the function and place of human rights in contemporary society, its central focus will be to explore the ltierary engagements with the idea of human rights in various nations and cultures. The 4 specific cases that our readings will focus on are post-colonial and post-partition South Asia; the Armenian genocide; the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission; and the Rwandan genocide.# #Yianna.Liatsos@ul.ie
EH6032#ISSUES IN MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY POETRY#This module will serve as an introduction to the study of contemporary poetry and poetics at a postgraduate level. It will be organized around theoretical, historical, and practical problems that have been critical to the field in the last century, such as  1) the challenge of the shifting subject and the lyric voice;  2) the reaction to and explosion of form;  3) changes to the field emanating from women, majority world poets, and poets of colour;  4) orality or shadow orality in verse, including issues to do with the digital revolution. Poetry to be examined in detail may include works by such poets as Lucille Clifton, Caroline Forche, Joy Harjo, Seamus Heaney, Susan Howe, Medbh McGuckian, Czeslaw Milosz, Sinead Morrissey, Tom Pickard, Adrienne Rich, Natasha Tretheway, and C. K. Williams.# #Niamh.Hehir@ul.ie

EH6042#FEMINIST LITERARY THEORY#This course will examine feminist and gender theories of literature and culture and will test their practical applications in the analysis of a range of women¿s writing. The emphasis of the course will be on exploring the relation between theory and practice: theories will be tested out in terms of their relevance to the literary texts under discussion. Topics for particular attention may include: Woman as writer: questions of canonicity and literary value; the concept of a female literary tradition; writing as revision. Psychoanalytic and poststructuralist feminist theories: writing and sexual difference; writing the body. The politics of location: theorising class, race, nation, and ethnicity; postcolonial theory. Writing gender and sexuality: lesbian criticism and queer theory; writing beyond sex and gender.# #Sinead.Mcdermott@ul.ie
EH6051#CREATIVE WRITING I#This module will enable students to evaluate writing--their own and their classmates as well as that of established assigned writers--within the frameworks of craft and technique.  Students will learn strategies for getting started, finding sources for ideas, and moving from ideas to drafts; consider the advantages and limitations of major genres; work on identifying "voice"; identify the role of sensory detail in establishing setting, mood, and character; work with figurative language; consider approaches to writing narrative and drama; develop convincing characterization and dialogue; and evaluate the role of narrative viewpoint.  In addition to learning the frameworks of craft and technique, students will learn strategies for revision and presentation of their work.  The module will encompass workshop sessions of student work as well as seminar sessions devoted to the analysis of the work of well-known established writers.# #

EH6062#IRISH AMERICAS IN LITERATURE AND CULTURE#The interaction of Irish and American culture has been central to the work of many well-known Irish and Irish-American literary writers; cultural cross-fertilisation between Ireland and the Americas also finds expression in shared customs, festivals, and in political allegiances. This module will introduce students to the patterns of reciprocal exchange and influence between Ireland and the Americas, predominantly in the realm of literary and cultural studies. Nineteenth-century Irish America, in particular, provides a textual model for later ethnic immigrant writing, and raises questions of representation, hybridity, belonging, and exclusion. The cultural production of Irish emigrants to other parts of the Americas is sometimes overlooked in scholarship on Irish-America; relatedly, there has been a tendency to see Irish-American heritage as a white, Anglophone culture, when in fact the picture is culturally and socially hybrid. Taking the "Greening of the Atlantic" as a central topic of study, this module will address multi-ethnic cultural exchanges resulting from Irish migrant communities in the Americas. These questions and more will be addressed through the study of relevant texts, including literary works, cultural events, film, music, and political actions.# #
EH6071#ADVANCED EDITING: CREATING A LITERARY JOURNAL#Over the course of the module, students will develop, in collaboration with faculty, a framework within which they can receive submissions of writing, creative and critical,  from students at the University of Limerick. The output for this course will emerge in the semester following the module as a yearly journal of UL-based writing, hosted by the MA in English and the MA in Creative Writing. While students on the MA programmes may submit their own creative and critical works, this module is intended to connect graduate studies in English to a broader campus initiative, drawing upon the literary creativity of the broader student community. In providing such a forum, this module will further students' applied experience in the examination, assessment and analysis of literary texts.

EH6072#SITUATING IRISH GOTHIC#This module traces the evolution of Irish gothic literature in the period c. 1800-1830, probing the contested issue of the existence of a peculiarly Irish Gothic tradition by placing exemplary Irish texts alongside contemporary British and European Gothic productions. Students will consider such questions as: How did Irish texts from this period fit in with those being written in neighbouring countries? How were they alike, and how did they differ? What influences did such works draw from English, French, German, and Scottish experiments with the supernatural and the fantastic? How did they, in turn, influence ongoing literary experimentation with the literary gothic in Britain and Europe? And, finally, what conclusions, if any, can we draw about the unique nature of an Irish gothic literary tradition?# #
EH6082#CREATIVE WRITING II#This course is a graduate level creative writing workshop, one which will primarily focus on the reading and critiquing of work written by those enrolled in the class.  Part of the class time will also include the reading and discussion of collections works by established writers. Students will learn about the practices of other writers and will develop their own skills as writers through peer review. Students will participate in regular writing activities, at the end of which they will have produced a portfolio of creative pieces which might be put forward for publication.# #
EH6092#RESEARCH METHODS IN CREATIVE WRITING#This module will instruct students in ways to integrate research in the composing process.  Students will learn how to conduct  in-person and on-line interviews; analyze various types of documents; and take detailed fieldnotes that record experiences, observations, and conversations.  From these sources students will develop a new piece of writing in a genre of their choice that is directly informed by what they have learned. Students will also study the evolution of a core text, from early drafts to published piece, with attention to how revision, publication, and audience response impact its evolution.# #
EH6102#ELEMENTS OF NARRATIVE AND DRAMA#In this module students will learn to identify the key elements of fiction and dramatic works, including plot, point of view, character, scene, narrative summary, dialogue, indirect discourse, description, setting, and style.  They will develop a critical vocabulary based on these key aspects and use it to interpret and evaluate the use of these aspects in key literary works.  Students will also read widely in narrative and dramatic theory and assess literary texts in light of this theory.# #Giles.Foden@ul.ie
EH6112#INDIVIDUAL CREATIVE WRITING PROJECT#This module follows on from the autumn term taught element of the MA in Creative Writing. Students must work independently with guidance from their supervisor.  Students must develop a plan, outline or first draft (or combination of all three) for an individual Creative Writing project. Using tutor guidance they must ensure that their work will be adequate to produce a piece of high-level Creative Writing, either as one piece or a group of related pieces, in one or more genres or forms. Target publication(s) or broadcast/performance venue(s) will be identified.

A learning environment will be created in which participants can explore their own relationship with their body, develop an awareness of the physical, emotional and subtle components of body reality, decipher the body's language, expression and symptoms and develop a language in which the above can be understood and related. The structure should be flexible enough to promote individual and group process, without losing it's clear focus on learning. The theoretical input will underpin the experiential nature of the module. Key themes will be: body awareness (thinking, imaging, sensing), energising the body, exploring movement, scanning the body and sensing into different parts of the body, energy flow and tension; body perception, body image - negative and positive body identity, what relationship do we have with our body; energy - what is it, how do we perceive it, contact channels (hands, arms, legs, mouth, nose, ears, eyes), grounding - hands,# #Gerry.Myers@ul.ie

The role of motivation is also discussed and an introduction to learner differences is included. Several concepts, such as intelligence and learning style will be critically examined as part of this module. An introduction is given to the personal, social and emotional development of young people, including ways in which this impacts on the second level school. Students will reflect on their own learning and show an awareness of how their approach differs from that of others. Students will be introduced to key educational thinkers and will be expected to develop an initial outline of their own educational philosophy# #

EN6171#PLANNING FOR SCHOOL PLACEMENT#This module supports the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes which will support student teachers in preparing for their teaching practice placement in semester 2. It introduces them to the importance of good practice when planning and preparing learner-centred, active learning experiences, including the development of learning resources. Students will have the opportunity to implement these plans in a small group setting with young pupils (Micro Teaching) and to reflect on their own learning from this experience. The module also addresses key issues in relation to the management of the learning environment, assessment for learning, mixed ability teaching, development education, and the effective use of ICT to support learning. A strong focus will be placed upon essential child welfare issues, the Teaching Council Code of Professional Conduct and the implications for student teachers. The module also provides the student teacher with an insight into educational provision in modern Ireland.# #

Under the supervision of a member of staff and guided by the industrial supervisor, the student will progress along a logical path to resolve the specified problem.  Initially within this semester, a literature search needs to be carried out and the initial design of experiment and objective clarified.  During the summer period of the third year the student is encouraged to explore the topic selected and to carry out a literature survey on same.   During the Autumn and early part of the Spring Semesters the student meets with the project supervisor at regular intervals where any problems which may arise are dealt with and plans are made for further work.   At these meetings the student is always encouraged to show initiative and imagination in developing the project.  Normally students undergo an interim assessment during week ten of the Autumn Semester, this is based on a verbal presentation of the work carried out to date.   The final assessment is based on the quality of the presented Project Report and any other relevant associated work.   The Grade for the Project is set after an interview of the student by the supervisor together with at least one other member of the academic staff.  The Project Report is typed on good quality A4 paper using a 12 point font and one-and-one-half line spacing.   All drawings are to BS 308 standard and other figures, photos and tables are to be properly annotated and neat in their presentation.

They will review some of the historical cases which have led to the code, and consider how adherence to the code could prevent future re-occurrence of such events. The final part of the activity will review how codes of conduct would impact upon their own research in UL.  Using examples students will debate what is best practice, and how to deal with issues of misconduct.  Activity 2 In this activity students will review the ethical principles underlying contemporary research. The activity will review the protection offered to participants by ethical guidelines. Reviewing some historical studies to highlight the value of ethical practice, the activity will then move on to consider ethical issues that arise in contemporary settings that have important implications for professional researchers.    Activity 3 Presentation of contemporary cases identified as part of coursework requirements for this course. Students should present the case they have identified and discuss the ethical implications of the case.

FI6012#PORTFOLIO RISK ANALYSIS#Structure of Module Part I :  Multivariate (Gaussian) Statistics After a brief overview of ôfinancial riskö and an early introduction to market ôvalue-at-riskö or Market VaR, we review relevant concepts and exploit results from the (multivariate) financial statistics and implementation schemes students will have encountered in both FI6011 and in FI6081. Part II :  Market Value at Risk û Standard Models and Methods The two best known approaches to computing the market VaR of a portfolio (aka ôVaR modelsö) are next considered; first the analytic Covariance VaR approach and in particular the numerical Simulation VaR method.  We critically analyse the advantages and limitations of the Covariance VaR method.  We then focus in more detail on the Monte Carlo Simulation approach to computing portfolio VaR (i.e. Monte Carlo VaR) û emphasising practitioner relevant concepts such as i) the use of volatility / correlation updating schemes such as GARCH, ii) full analytic revaluation capability and iii) the use of covariance matrix decomposition schemes to model the desired correlation structure of the portfolio.  Finally, we show how PCA can be implemented to compute VaR in a more computationally-efficient manner than Monte Carlo VaR.  Building on FI6081 the acquisition of practical implementation skills will be emphasised through the validation of Alexander CD VaR spreadsheet results with those generated from assigned Matlab tutorials and projects.  Part II will conclude with a discussion of how model validation or backtesting as well as scenario analysis / stress testing requirements have been outlined in the Basel Accords and how they are implemented by market practitioners. Part III :  Value at Risk û Non-Gaussian Models and Methods In the final part of the course we relax the standard Gaussian assumption for the P&L distribution.  We first focus on the application of Extreme Value (EV) Theory and on the class of æExtreme Value DistributionsÆ in measuring portfolio risk when empirical distributions are known to be æfat-tailedÆ.  We again emphasise implementation issues by using Matlab to æfitÆ or calibrate a number of well-known EV distributions to the tails of asset return distributions.  We next consider the class of Stable and Hyperbolic Distributions which are flexible enough to model the entire distribution and simultaneously account for non-normality anomalies such as skewness and excess kurtosis.  Finally, we consider the use of analytically tractable Normal Mixture Distributions in modelling high-frequency (e.g. intra-day) financial returns and in imputing VaR measures in conjunction with the Covariance VaR method.#Spring#

With reference to a number of 19th and 20th Century texts, the forms and ambiguities of a French universal will be unpacked. The later stages of the module will be devoted to two interconnected realities - the revision of universalist positions in a post-colonial context (with specific reference to selected Francophone texts), and the question of literary cosmopolitanism (with reference to the works by writers who have adopted the French language for various reasons). The contemporary question of a littérature-monde in French will be one of the objects of concluding discussions.# #

GA6091#CRITICAL IRISH STUDIES 1: CORE ISSUES AND TEXTS#The module will be organized around five 'texts' that present the problems to be analysed and the issues they raise. Students will engage actively in the problems to be solved, write critical essays addressing those problems, and begin to explore their own contributions to the field of study. As the students move from one 'text' to the next over the course of the term, encountering, for example, a political document, then a piece of music, then a historical event, then a novel, they will learn critical methods that will help them as they take modules in different disciplines and develop their own research projects.# #Margaret.Harper@ul.ie

GA6102#CRITICAL IRISH STUDIES II: LITERATURES AND CONTEXTS#This module charts the development of Irish literature in both languages from the predominantly Irish-speaking society of the 18th century to the predominantly Anglophone 21st century. Though taught in English, the course will include detailed close analysis of key texts in the original Irish. This will be useful to students working in Irish, but knowledge of Irish is not mandatory for the course. Seminal texts such as Cúirt an Mheán Oíche/The Midnight Court by Brian Merriman, will be analysed using different interpretative approaches pertaining to aesthetics, creativity, gender, subversion, and parody but also to historical, cultural, and sociolinguistic contexts and discourses. The module surveys the antiquarian revivals of the Romantic period, and studies the scholarship and writing of Charlotte Brooke and Sydney Owenson, and their contemporaries Máire Bhuí Ní Laeire, Tomás Rua Ó Súilleabháin and Raiftearaí. More recently, the module considers cultural and linguistic interactions in contemporary Irish poetry, such as in the work of Paul Muldoon, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, and Limerick poet Michael Hartnett.# #
GA6104#IRISH FOLKLORE, ORAL TRADITION AND ETHNOLOGY#Irish folklore and oral arts constitute a rich and varied tapestry of cultural forms through which social and aesthetic meanings are created and recreated, and through which identity is negotiated and articulated.  Traditional arts and practices represent the social, cultural and aesthetic discourses of unofficial and popular Irish culture and human experience, which are vital to a comprehensive understanding of Irish history, literature and culture.  Folklore and tradition, rather than being interpreted as passive cultural forms which statically 'reflect' attitudes, are here seen as dynamic creative forms through which culture and meaning are forged.   This module will focus on interpretative approaches and research skills in key areas in Irish Folklore studies, including: &bull; oral narrative and storytelling  &bull; oral poetry, singing and performance including oral transmission and composition &bull; cosmology, belief, customs and ritual &bull; traditional dress and material culture  &bull; ethnographic and ethnological approaches to the research and interpretation of culture, social contexts and traditional verbal arts.# #
GE3001#GERMAN FOR BEGINNERS#This module aims to introduce students to German and gradually develop their ability to the level of A1 as outlined by the Common European Framework for Languages.

The module will allow students gain sufficient proficiency in German to: &bull; manage to pronounce very short, isolated mainly ready-made expressions; &bull; show a limited control of a few simple grammatical structures;  &bull; use a very basic repertoire of words related to personal details; &bull; use a limited range of vocabulary to talk about particular concrete situations; &bull; use a small range of ready-made expressions and phrases related to everyday topics (introductions, leave-taking, apologies); &bull; write simple isolated phrases and sentences on everyday topics# #Cinta.Ramblado@ul.ie

GE6001#GERMAN LANGUAGE CULTURE IN EUROPE I: TRANSCULTURAL SPACES - THEORY AND TEXTUAL PRACTICE#Students will be introduced to theoretical approaches, discuss them in the framework of transcultural studies, and apply them to texts by German-speaking authors, which put forward or question ideas of inter- or transcultural spaces in a European or global context. The analysis includes the cultural and aesthetic dimension of such constructs.   While the module will take a broad definition of primary texts to include historical, political and visual texts and will take a wider historical dimension into account, its main focus will be on literature of the 20th and 21st Century. German-speaking authors have found themselves at the centre of historical turning points within this period: from the First and Second World War to the end of the Cold War in 1989, each of them leading to shifting political borders, ideas of a new Europe and different experiences of migration. These have been reflected in constructs of cultural identity and space in their texts, affirming and transgressing traditional boundaries, which will be explored in the module.# #Marieke.Krajenbrink@ul.ie
GE6002#GERMAN LANGUAGE CULTURE IN EUROPE II: GERMAN LITERATURE IN A COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN CONTEXT#The module will give an overview of the manifold and multi-facetted connections between literature in German and other European literatures, and introduce students to theoretical approaches to the study of literature in a wider inter- and  transnational context. It will focus on themes such as the reception of foreign literature in Germany and the reception of German literature abroad [examples may relate to canonized individual authors (e.g. Heine, Wagner, Kafka, T. & H. Mann, Feuchtwanger, Brecht, Grass, Jelinek); travel literature; exile literature and migration literature; Europe as a topic in German language writing; literary responses to European political events; European myths in German writing. In analysing selected literary texts (and their cinematic adaptations), the emphasis will be on how German-language literature and culture is situated in a European and transnational context.# #Joachim.Fischer@ul.ie

Following a theoretical introduction to discursive aspects of text analysis, students will engage with its practical application, working on a variety of German texts concerning contemporary issues from different media. The emphasis throughout this module is on practical written and oral training in text analysis, translation and presentation skills. Assessment of the module will consider both analytical and linguistic competencies.# #Joachim.Fischer@ul.ie

It will then focus on the area of film and film analysis and give an overview to the history of film in the German-speaking countries. In analysing selected films from different periods and genres, particular attention will be paid to inter- and cross cultural aspects placing German film within a broader European context. This will include questions visual images of other countries, aspects of film reception, the international nature of the film industry, film within the context of EU cultural policy.# #Joachim.Fischer@ul.ie

GE6021#GERMAN - IRISH CULTURAL CONNECTIONS#Irish-German cultural relations encompass a multi-faceted research area - the manifold connections not only between Germany and Ireland in past and present but also Irish-Austrian and Irish-Swiss relations. This module aims to provide an in-depth introduction to these links, building on the unique research expertise available at the Centre for Irish-German Studies at the University of Limerick by introducing concepts, methodologies and sources for these bilateral relations. Aspects of intercultural communications at different levels (including misunderstandings) will be analysed as well as the origins of mutual images and their repercussions. Historical and contemporary representations of connections between Ireland and the German-speaking countries will be explored in fictional and non-fictional texts and other media (film, architecture, music, art etc.), the results will be placed within the context of relationships within in Europe.# #Joachim.Fischer@ul.ie
GE6022#GERMAN LANGUAGE IN EDUCATION:POLICY AND PRACTICE#The module comprises three blocks which examine the extent to which broader political agendas impact upon language-in-education policy and language practices. Particular emphasis is placed on the analysis of public debate on the German language in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The module covers three main areas:   1. Language-in-education and integration: studies the school as a locus of integration policy, analysing debates surrounding the role of German/community languages within school, multicultural identity and educational performance.    2. Education and multilingualism: explores multilingual policy and practice, in particular the experience of 'bilingual schools' promoting content-and-language-integrated learning (CLIL) approaches to the learning of German and other languages.   3. Language and academia: investigates attitudes towards, and status of, German as a language of science and academia, focusing primarily on the rationale and impact of national policy decisions to promote internationalisation within the higher education system.# #Jean.Conacher@ul.ie
GE6031#THE GERMAN LANGUAGE TODAY#The module is divided into four blocks which approach the study of the contemporary linguistic situation in the German-speaking world from complementary perspectives:    1. Key societal developments in the history of the German language, relating in particular to the development of written and oral standard forms (e.g. linguistic practice within the Hanseatic League, the impact of invention of printing, Luther's Bible translation).    2. Language and ideology: this theme explores aspects of language and nation-building, language in Nazi Germany, language in the two Germanies and their impact on language attitudes today inside and outside the German-speaking world.    3. Language variation and language contact: national and regional variation (e.g. Swiss German, Low German); speech communities; social bilingualism; influence of English   4. Language policy and  language planning: corpus/status/acquisition planning: explores debates surrounding contemporary issues of language planning and practice, e.g. 1996 Spelling Reform, language and constitution, language and citizenship.# #Jean.Conacher@ul.ie
GE6032#THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TRANSLATION (GERMAN)#A study of the major translation theories is undertaken, focusing on the twentieth century and current developments in this area. The module entails systematic analysis of key, often contested, concepts such as literality, transparency, equivalence, foreignisation and (in)visibility, second-order representation and the 'cultural turn'. The relevance of these to a number of social variables such as identity, culture and gender is investigated and highlighted and the fundamentally ideological nature of translation theory and practice is emphasised.  Students are strongly encouraged to bring to bear relevant theoretical insights to the practice of translation of texts from a variety of areas chosen for their relevance to other modules on the programme, particularly in the media, socio-economic and literary areas. Students will also engage with aspects of work as a professional translator, including ethics, integration of translation software in the translation process and localisation.# #Jean.Conacher@ul.ie

GY6723#Urbanisation, Urban Geography and Planning#This module aims to provide students with an understanding of contemporary patterns of urban growth and development. Students will be familiarised with debates, definitions and theoretical frameworks pertaining to differential urbanisation and the cycle of urbanisation, the size distribution of urban settlements, and the impact of the specialisation and diversity in the urban economic base which creates our distinctive cities. While the module will focus on world cities and transnational urban networks, it will specifically concentrate on the Irish context as it seeks to examine models and patterns of land value and land use, household location and the socio-spatial structure of urban areas. In the context of the on-going Limerick Regeneration project the module will examine social polarisation and residential segregation in the post-Fordist city, governance and jurisdictional fragmentation in the contemporary metropolis, land use planning, zoning and development control, urban renewal and regeneration in creating a sustainable city. The course will incorporate field studies, the extent of which will depend on numbers taking up the module.

IN6011#RISK AND DERIVATIVE MARKETS#The purpose of this module is to give students a thorough grounding in the qualitative principles and existing quantitative methodologies for modelling financial risk by developing a strong understanding of derivatives and derivative markets. The module commences with a look at simple derivative instruments such as futures and forwards and quickly progresses to cover options (on stocks, indices, currencies etc), exotic options and option trading strategies, fixed income derivative instruments such as swaps and treasury futures. The final part of the module will provide the foundations needed for modelling financial risk including market, liquidity, credit, and model risk. The theoretical aspects of risk forecasting will include in particular: volatility, value-at-risk and expected shortfall methodologies. The theoretical material in this module is fundamental in the understanding of modem trading dynamics, risk management and compliance roles. To emphasis the implementation of the theoretical knowledge, the KBS Trading Floor will be used as a key physical asset and will underscore the lecture material with contemporary examples and assignments. This experience significantly differentiates the student at interview stage.# #

MD4001#PRACTICUM 1A#This module is divided into two parts.  The first is the development of the studentsÆ performance practice will occur in the stylistic context most common to the performance practice of the student.  However tutors will begin to encourage students to look to other styles and repertoires current within a primarily Irish context.  This will take place in the context of one-on-one classes and develops from the progress in Practicum 1a and 2a.  The second part of these modules will be related to performance skills and again this element will be divided into two separate streams for musicians and dancers.  Musicians will take Keyboard Skills and Aural Training which will include keyboard harmony (vamping, chordal analysis and application, both aural and written), aural skills (transcribing tunes and songs, awareness of traditional forms and styles, sight reading and sight singing).  It is important to emphasise that the orientation of this stream of multi-skill development will be towards the needs and realities of traditional Irish music and musicians but with a wider context in mind.  Dancers will take Movement Awareness.  This will include practical dance workshops to introduce some of the movement principles that inform other dance practices today.   It will also include an introduction to techniques and practices designed to promote the release of tension in the body in order to facilitate greater ease of movement.  It will also include an introduction to the use of visual imagery as a way to develop an understanding of the correct alignment in movement.  Finally an introduction to supplementary practices used by dancers as part of their training eg. Yoga, Feldankrais, Alexander technique and Pilates. Improvisation will be undertaken in practical workshops to introduce the concept of improvisation as a means of exploring movement possibilities and also expanding movement vocabulary. Improvisations will include working with movement themes, dramatic themes, props, text  and  visual stimuli.#Autumn#Niall.Keegan@ul.ie

ME6051#ADVANCED TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION FOR ENGINEERS#This module builds a foundation for the dissemination of research results by preparing engineering students for publishing/writing as a part of their professional careers and/or further postgraduate studies. Students in this module examine the communicative, metacognitive, affective and social strategies that they employ as they negotiate their way through their writing, research and publishing processes. Students develop criteria for measuring the effectiveness of the strategies they employ as they go through these three processes and develop strategies for developing alternatives to ineffective strategies. Students also learn to assess the context into which they write in order to better inform their lexical, grammatical, rhetorical and ethical choices. Such choices take audience and purpose into account as well as genre: industrially focused conferences/seminars, academic conferences and academic journal articles. Students learn the transferable value of skills employed for contextual assessment to other professional writing contexts and develop and begin exercising a long-term writing-for-publication strategy.# #Lawrence.Cleary@ul.ie

MG4013#Microeconomics#The question of what is economics is explored.  In answering this question emphasis is placed on the importance of key concepts such as scarcity, individual decision-making, trade-offs and opportunity cost.  Students are also introduced to the distinctions between microeconomics vs macroeconomics and normative vs positive economics. Markets as a means of organising economic activity are examined.  The model of supply and demand is used to understand how market equilibrium prices and quantities are determined.  You not only learn how equilibrium is determined, but how relative prices are used by consumers and suppliers to make decisions about the use of societyÆs scarce resources.  Supply and demand curves are used to explain the movements of prices and the allocation of resources in a market economy such as ours.  The sensitivity of demand and supply to changes in key variables such as price and income is analysed through measures and discussions of elasticity which is briefly introduced.   Individual decisions are examined to show how they come together to form the demand curve.  Consumer choice using indifference curve analysis is introduced. Shifting the focus back to the market process the latter part of the module focuses its attention on supply and costs of production.  Students examine the different ôtypes of costsö and how costs affect revenue and profits. Cost concepts and how they relate to a perfectly competitive firmÆs supply decision are examined.  At the other end of the competitive spectrum is the complete absence of market competition.  This situation of monopoly (single priced vs price discrimination monopolists) is also studied  Syllabus: What is economics; scarcity;  individual decision-making;  trade-offs and opportunity cost;  microeconomics vs macroeconomics;  normative vs positive economics; markets;  model of demand and supply; market equilibrium and disequilibrium;   scarce resources; elasticity; consumer choice theory using indifference curves and budget constraints; costs of production; revenue; profits; market structures; perfect competition; monopoly (single priced vs price discrimination monopolists).#Autumn#Helena.Lenihan@ul.ie

PA4037#PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE#This module is delivered in two parts.  Part 1 will focus on establishing the foundations upon which  consideration of public administration and social justice can be built. It does so by presenting the main theoretical approaches to social justice and by looking at the main discourses that inform public policy considerations of social exclusion / inclusion. It also outlines the range of potential influences on thinking about social justice including constitutional obligations; national and international legislative / treaty commitments and moral / religious factors.  Part 1 of the module concludes with consideration of social justice in contemporary societies, using a student led collaborative case study approach. Part 2 of the module turns its attention to the more specific role of public administration in relation to the design / pursuit of social justice objectives.  It explores key issues such as the politics - administration dichotomy, bureaucratic neutrality and values and ethics in public administration.  The module also looks at the place of social justice objectives within changing public administration paradigms, including new public management and investigates some empirical examples of how public administration in different countries engages with a social justice agenda.# #

We proceed by examining the historical development of welfare states in Europe, their growth and contraction and associated political movements and look at the impact of these on state administration. Towards the end of the module, we will attempt to apply the ideas and concepts that we have explored at a more general and European level specifically to the Irish case. We end with a series of contemporary Irish case studies which critically examine the most recent (alleged) ætransformationÆ of the Irish state.# #

PO4117#POLICY-MAKING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION#This module takes a detailed look at the policy-making process of the EU. Few EU policies directly redistribute money, yet even if they sometimes seem to focus on rather arcane technical issues, they often have profound consequences for the legal rights and the welfare of individual citizens, the competitiveness of particular companies or entire industries, and the social, economic, and democratic development of Europe as a whole. If we want to evaluate the functioning of the EU as a democratic political system, we need to know who is involved in the formulation and implementation of those policies, to what extent these actors and the structural characteristics of the process influence the shape and content of those policies, and why different actors and structural characteristics vary in their influence on policy outcomes. These are the types of questions discussed in this module.   Module outline: - Introduction and historical background - The institutional framework - Policies and policy-making - Theories of European integration and policy-making - Agenda-setting - EP decision-making - Council decision-making - Bicameral bargaining - Transposition and implementation - Enforcement and judicial review - Evaluation# #Frank.Haege@ul.ie

PS4057#PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS# # #
PS4062#INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY APPLIED TO NURSING AND MIDWIFERY#An introduction to psychological theory, which includes developmental psychology throughout the life span, behavioural psychology, principles of sensation, perception, cognition, consciousness, emotion, motivation and personality, health psychology, stress management, coping and foundations of  biological psychology, psychological impact of illness and hospitalisation and  an  introduction to the main categories of abnormal behaviour.# #
PS4067#PERSONALITY 2# # #
PS4087#POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY#The specific focus of this module is political psychology.  Political psychology is an interdisciplinary area of psychology.  The course provides an introduction to the psychological foundations of political life. Psychological theories are applied to particular political problems including the formation of belief systems, moral reasoning and ideology, colonialism, political socialization, political culture, mass hysteria, psychohistory. In doing so,  it is demonstrated how psychology informs political behaviours and actions, the behaviour of politicians and the effects of social and political structures on behaviour.#Spring#anca.minescu@ul.ie
PS4097#DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY#The specific focus of this module is developmental psychopathology.  Developmental psychopathology is a domain of psychology which concentrates on how psychosocial and biological factors contribute to psychological adjustment and maladjustment.  The module will introduce students evidence relating both environmental and genetic determinants of mental health and consider the role that developmental factors may have in the expression of mental health problems.#Autumn#Orla.Muldoon@ul.ie
PS4098#COGNITION 2# # #Orla.Muldoon@ul.ie
PS4107#ABNORMAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY#Through a series of lectures, students will be introduced to the theoretical perspective on several categories of common mental health disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders. In addition, other topics in abnormal psychology, such as dysfunctional behaviour, will be examined from a range of perspectives, including cognitive, behavioural, and neurological. The focus is on how psychological models, particularly cognitive ones, can aid our understanding of psychological disorders. The course will also examine how the theoretical understanding of disorders translates into practice in clinical settings. Contemporary models of clinical practice and psychotherapeutic intervention will be introduced, including scientist and reflective practitioner models, and formulation and assessment models of clinical psychology. The link between clinical psychology and health care settings will also be explored. In this way we will demonstrate that psychological models have considerable application to clinical practice. This provides a valuable introduction to key issues and concepts that will be experienced in clinical practice, by students who decide to move into clinical work after graduation.# #
PS4108#APPROACHES TO SOCIAL IDENTITY#The Social Identity approach in social psychology originated in an interdisciplinary effort to explain large-scale intergroup conflict. Drawing upon sociology, social anthropology and social cognition it aimed to provide a comprehensive account of intergroup relations from the individual perspective to the group level. However, in the four decades since its inception the Social Identity approach has become overwhelmingly cognitive and experimental in focus and lost links with other disciplines and methodologies. This module places the Social Identity perspective in its historical context and introduces students to cognate theories and methods elsewhere in social psychology and in other disciplines with a view to enriching their understanding of social psychology. Topics include: evolution of the Social Identity approach; advances in Self Categorisation Theory; discursive approaches to social identities; ethnography and displays of identity; approaches to national identity.#Autumn#
PS4138#HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY#Health Psychology is a sub-discipline of relatively recent origin in psychology, but is rapidly developing a unique identity.  Whilst having some concerns in common with clinical psychology- health psychology is concerned with both mental and physical health and in particular their inter-relationship- it is quite distinct from that discipline. Its range of interest is wide and continues to develop, but the discipline by its nature is interdisciplinary, requiring the study of variables at the biological, psychological and social levels.  It is an area that is often controversial, reflecting in part, the methodological and conceptual problems inherent in a subject straddling several disciplines. Topics covered include Models of health behaviour, stress, psychoneuroimmunology#Spring#Stephen.Gallagher@ul.ie
PS4158#PSYCHOLOGY AND GENDER#The specific focus of this module is the role that gender plays in contemporary psychology.  Traditionally psychologists construct gender as a variable that must be controlled in their experimental paradigm.  How gender is not a dichotomous variable, rather a social construction that is used to facilitate our interpretation of the world.  By adopting this critical stance, students will be encourage to explore the motivations around studies that examine gender differences in psychological attributes.  By exploring a range of key area such as gender and IQ, parental and child attachment behaviour, work and family roles, the development of gender in childhood, gender and mental health, the pervasive and assumed impact of gendered thought on our understandings of behaviour will be considered.#Autumn#
PS4168#ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY#Through a series of lectures, students will be introduced to historical and contemporary theories in decision making, (e.g., prospect theory, heuristics, mental accounting), and the influence of situational and personal variables on preference and choice. Specifically, lectures will focus on variables such as situational cues, sociological conditions, emotional states, self-control capacities, and individual differences. The lecture series will also address consequences of economic behaviour for people on a personal level, such as their subjective well-being, and on a societal level, such as unemployment. Throughout the lecture series, theory building in economic psychology and the application of findings in this research area will be critically discussed.# #
PS4178#HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY# # #
PS4188#EDUCATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE#Cognitive neuroscience has contributed to the field of educational psychology through its elucidation of the cognitive and neural mechanisms of cognitive processes related to learning, academic skills and disorders which affect learning.  This module will begin with a general overview of the fields of educational psychology and cognitive neuroscience.  This will be followed by an examination of the contribution that cognitive neuroscience has made to the understanding of cognitive processes related to learning (e.g. intelligence, attention, memory), academic skills (e.g., reading, maths) and related disorders (e.g., general learning difficulty, Aattention Deficit with and without Hyperactivity Disorder[ADHD], dyslexia, dyscalculia).# #

PS5131#RESEARCH METHODS#Seminars will be organised between faculty around a series of research clusters that will be defined according to the proposed dissertation contents of student research. The clusters will be organised so that faculty from related areas (empricially or methodologically) will be available to discuss the progression of student MA dissertation work in terms of research design and implementation.#Spring#Rory.costello@ul.ie
PS6003#MAJOR RESEARCH PROJECT (PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE)#Within this module, student will actively conduct research and will report and discuss the research that they have undertaken. We expect students to build on the education that they received on research designs, methods of analysis, professional skills, and particular psychological contents. Students are encouraged to select a research area of interest and develop their own research questions. They will be assisted in the development of research questions and encouraged to keep the project to manageable proportions.# #
PS6022#ADVANCED EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY#This module primarily covers experimental research methods, quasi-experimental research designs and longitudinal research designs with a focus on both the technicalities involved in using these methods and the rationale that underlie these procedures. In laboratory and fieldwork settings, students will learn how to use these methods and will demonstrate independent research skills in two research projects relating to these procedures. The tutorials are designed to facilitate critically reflection on the purpose and rationale of research methods and to discuss alternative research procedures.# #
PS6032#ADVANCED ANALYSIS IN PSYCHOLOGY 2#This module builds on ¿Advanced Analyses 1¿. Psychology makes use of many different statistical methods. Researchers need to decide which method is most appropriate to examine particular research questions. In order to make these decisions, researchers have to know the pros and cons of particular statistical analyses. Therefore, this module examines the underlying rationale, benefits, and problems of a variety of advanced statistical methods. The statistical techniques taught include profile analysis, structural equation modelling, and meta-analysis.# #
PS6041#ADVANCED RESEARCH DESIGNS IN PSYCHOLOGY#This module covers the rationale of methods in both basic and applied research. Students will learn how to investigate research questions by using the appropriate research designs. Pros and cons of several research designs will be discussed. Specifically, we will discuss the merits of experimental methods, non-experimental methods, qualitative methods, implicit methods, explicit methods, computer simulations, and mixed-methods approaches. Besides teaching students the rationale of advanced research designs, this module seeks to teach students the tools that may need for their own research.# #anca.minescu@ul.ie
PS6042#QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN METHODS IN PSYCHOLOGY#The module assumes familiarity with the basic concepts of quantitative research design and data analysis in psychology and critiques these, exploring how different views of the world enable us to use data in different ways. Specific qualitative methods are covered in detail, distinguishing between methods that are primarily realist (treating qualitative data as straightforward representations of how the world really is) or constructionist (exploring how qualitative data represent processes through which the social world is actively constructed by people). The module depends heavily on students' engagement with data and methods to achieve learning objectives.# #Mike.Quayle@ul.ie
PS6051#ADVANCED ANALYSIS IN PSYCHOLOGY 1#Researchers in psychology need to decide which statistical method is most appropriate to a given research question or a particular data set. In order to make these decisions, researchers must understand the basic principles that underlie statistical analyses and have the skills to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of one technique over another. Two modules will examine the underlying principles, strengths and limitations of a range of statistical methods. The modules provide intensive instruction in the use of statistical analyses commonly used in psychology. The statistical techniques taught in this module, the first of a two-part module sequence, include multiple regression, canonical correlation, analysis of covariance, multivariate analysis of variance and covariance, repeated measures analysis, profile analysis, and logistic regression. Besides understanding the principles, benefits and limitations of these statistical methods, students will also learn how to use these methods with computer software.# #
PS6052#PROFESSIONAL SKILLS IN PSYCHOLOGY 2#This module is the first part of a two-module sequence designed to teach presentation skills. Presentation skills are important in human interaction. Poor presentations increase the likelihood that messages are not or falsely understood by listeners. In order to successfully communicate, students need to train their verbal skills. In this module, students will be given feedback on their verbal skill with the goal of improving presentations and interviewing techniques. We will explain functional and non-functional elements of verbal skills. Students will rehearse their skills in particular contexts (e.g., conferences settings, classrooms settings, interviews).# #aisling.odonnell@ul.ie
PS6061#PROFESSIONAL SKILLS IN PSYCHOLOGY 1#This course is the second part of a two-course sequence on professional skills. In order to successfully communicate research, students need to train their writing skills. In this module, students we want to improve students writing skills by means of giving good examples for writing styles and by giving students feedback on their writing skills. Consistent with the purpose of the module, it is intensive in writing.# #
PS6062#ADVANCED PERSPECTIVES IN SOCIAL IDENTITY RESEARCH#The module will give an overview to traditional social identity theory and later developments in the self categorisation approach. Particular emphasis will be placed on theoretical advances in the field over the last two decades emphasising the emotional components of identity, the strategic use of identity and the multidimensionality and multiplicity of identities. We will cover applications in the areas of health psychology, organisational psychology, and clinical psychology. The overall emphasis in discussing these topics will be on social change and improving personal well-being.# #
PS6071#SOCIAL INFLUENCE AND ATTITUDE CHANGE#Social influence and attitude change are two core issues in psychology. Human interactions involve different forms of social influence and changes in attitudes. In this module we will examine basic cognitive and affective levels as well as the more social levels (e.g., groups) which determine social influence and attitude change. We will review important, representative contributions to social influence and attitude change. We will provide a historical perspective on the development of theories and paradigms in these areas of research. In addition, we will discuss with students whether and how the prominent theories on social influence and attitude change can be applied to everyday life situations.# #aisling.odonnell@ul.ie
PS6072#COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY#In this module, students will learn about psychological processes that are concerned with the relationships of individuals with communities and societies. Based on the core values of community psychology (individual and family wellness, sense of community, respect for human diversity, social justice, citizen participation, collaboration and community strengths, and empirical grounding; see Dalton, Elias, & Wandersman, 2007) a particular emphasis will be given to actions that enhance quality of life for individuals, communities, and societies. In this sense, students will have the opportunity to reflect on the core values of this field, its goals, and the methods that are normally used in community psychology research. In addition, student will be actively involved in community psychology oprojects.# #
PS6081#PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION MAKING#People solve problems and make decision all of the time, but only sometimes do people succeed. In this module, students will learn about the prominent theories and applications in problem solving and decision making. We will touch on different kinds of problems and decisions (personal, inter-personal, group context) in different contexts (e.g., relationships, economics). We will contrast typical strategies that people use to the strategies that would make problem solving and decision making more effective and efficient.# #
PS6091#CLINICAL MODELS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS#The module will provide a valuable introduction to key issues and concepts in clinical psychology. Students will be introduced to prominent psychological disorders (e.g., anxieties, dissociative and somatoform disorders, mood disorders, schizophrenia, personality disorders). The module will also focus on historical and recent approaches that explain the development and the persistence of these disorders. These perspectives will include, for example, psychodynamic, behavioural, cognitive, and systemic approaches. The validity of these clinical models will be discussed by considering up-to-date research in clinical psychology. The lecture series will provide overviews to the topics and the tutorials will allow for in-depth discussions of clinical models of psychological disorders in class.# #
PS6092#METHODS OF CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTION#The first half of the lectures series will give an overview of methods of clinical diagnosis (e.g., psychological tests, interviews, clinical manuals). The focus will be on the degree to which these methods of diagnosis are reliable and valid. The second half of the lecture series will introduce methods of intervention (e.g., psychotherapies, psycho-social interventions, prevention) and will discuss their effectiveness and suitability depending on the disorder and the social context. The tutorials will focus in detail on the factors that contribute to effective clinical interviews.# #
PS6101#PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES#Personality is a collection of emotion, thought and behaviour patterns that are unique to an individual. Through a series of lectures and practical tutorial sessions, topics relevant to the psychology of personality will be explored; including defining personality, temperament, aptitude and difference; personality and intelligence testing; and models including factorial models, typologies and circumplexes.# #
PS6102#DEVELOPMENTAL AND LIFESPAN PSYCHOLGOY#This module provides students with foundation information about how psychologists have studied human development from prenatal life through childhood, adolescence and the stages of adult life including older adulthood. The course will require students to reflect critically on recent empirical studies examining human development through these life stages. The course will focus on the topics of cogntive, biological, social and moral development, from the field of psychology.  These topics are studied from a lifespan perspective.# #
PS6111#BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY#Structure and function of the mammalian nervous system with reference to the biological bases of major classes of behaviour, including neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, role of neurotransmitters in brain function, CNS and endocrine influences on behaviour, localisation of brain function, the importance and limitations the of case study approach and animal research.# #

These studies will be based on the critically discussed literature.# #
PS8011#MOTIVATION AND THE SELF#This module primarily covers experimental research and theories from the domains of motivation, memory and the self that deal with the tendencies, experiences, and functions of self-enhancement and self-protection, among other basic self motives (e.g., verification). These topics will be approached from both a cognitive perspective (e.g., appraisal theories, neuroscience, memory), a motivational perspective (e.g., self-regulation, coping) and social perspectives (e.g., social comparison). Students will learn to critically reflect on, and integrate, recent research findings and theories of self motives during tutorials. Moreover, during labs students will actively create studies, collect data, and analyse results based on predictions derived from the literature in order to familiarize them with the procedures associated with emotion research and the challenges emotion researchers face.# #
PS8021#COGNITIVE AND MOTIVATIONAL APPROACHES TO EMOTION#This module primarily covers experimental research and theories from the domains of motivation and cognition that deal with the expressions (e.g., bodily expression, communication), experiences (e.g., cognitive appraisals, goal activation), and functions (e.g., goal-pursuit, decision making) of emotions. These topics will be approached from both a cognitive perspective (e.g., appraisal theories, neuropsychological insights) as well as a motivational perspective (e.g., self-regulation, coping). Students learn to critically reflect and integrate recent research findings and theories of emotions during tutorials. Moreover, during labs students will actively create studies, collect data, and analyse results based on predictions derived from the literature in order to familiarize them with the procedures associated with emotion research and the challenges emotion researchers face.# #

For most diploma students, this course represents the first introduction to self-originating research, not only in terms of æun-packingÆ research into its elemental steps but in drawing on a greater understanding of those elements to conceive, design and carry out research themselves. The learning curve demanded is considerable.  Students are assessed on the basis of two pieces of submitted work. The first is a one-page reflexive account of their experience of undertaking primary research (æfieldworkÆ) and will carry 25% of the final grade. The 2,000-word essay submitted at the end of the Spring semester will carry 65% of the final grade. The extant 10% will be based on class attendance and participation.#Spring#Patrick.Fitzpatrick@staffmail.ul.ie
SO3111#METHODOLOGY#Over the course of the semester, students will be introduced to qualitative and feminist research methods. The course will æunpackÆ research into its different stages: from identifying a research topic, devising research questions to guide it and identifying an appropriate methodology to undertake the research, through collection of data, analysis of data and æwriting upÆ the research. The course will explore what makes certain research æfeministÆ and what might be termed general characteristics of feminist research. The course will also consider other factors that affect how qualitative research is undertaken, from available resources to the ethics of research. Through individual and group work, students will identify a topic of research and design a research proposal.  Students will be asked to read a piece of research and, in a group, answer questions on it. They will informally present in groups and will be assessed on this. They will also be required to submit a one-page research proposal for a piece of self-originating research. Assessment will be based on these two pieces of work, and on class attendance and participation.#Autumn#

SO4036#CONTEMPORARY SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY#This module aims to broaden and deepen students engagement with and understanding of the development of sociology as a discipline following on from their introduction to the sociological classics. It introduces students to a selection of modern and contemporary theories as a way of understanding how sociological theory has developed to reflect changing social and intellectual contexts. The course will identify the extent to which the selected theories build on key classical presuppositions or offer more radical departures in terms of the key analytical debates within sociology. As a way of elucidating these issues, substantive topics will be discussed in relation to the different theoretical perspectives. The range of theoretical perspectives will encompass the following: social constructionism (Berger and Luckmann); the sociology of the everyday (e.g. Goffman, Blumer); critical theory (e.g. Foucault, Habermas, Feminist Theory and theories of late/post-modernity; theories of rationality (Rational Choice/Rational Action theory); and the theory of social practice (Bourdieu).# #Lee.Monaghan@ul.ie

SO4073#CLASSIC SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY#The module begins by outlining the socio-historical transformations (industrialisation, urbanisation, expansion of capitalism) that gave rise to classic social theory. Key thinkers, who sought to make sense of modernity and `the problem of social reality¿, are then discussed; such as: Mark, Durkheim, Weber, Simmel, Mead and Schutz. Discussion will focus on their different analyses of, among other things: the development of capitalism and the money economy; the division of labour; social solidarity; class conflict and ideology; rationalisation; religious life; the structures of the life-world; the dynamics of symbolic interactions and the self. The module considers analyses of historically unfolding macro-social structures, meso-social formations (e.g. bureaucratic organisation) and the vicissitudes of everyday life. The import of classic social theory to the discipline of sociology - including its aims, scope and analyses of modernity ¿ is a theme that runs through the module.# #
SO4077#SOCIOLOGY OF YOUTH#This module is focused on the study of young people (middle to late adolescence) in Irish society and addresses a number of critical questions which are rooted in traditional sociological concerns about power, inequality and representation. In addressing these questions, students will be asked to analytically engage with theoretical perspectives on youth as it intersects with material categories of social class, gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity. Young people¿s experiences and interactions with the key social structures of education, the community, the family and work; as well as issues around time and space; young people¿s life styles and the existence of gender differentiated cultures will be explored through classic and contemporary empirical research.  Public media and policy representations of youth will also be addressed in the context of contemporary media discourse which constructs young people as a wide ranging social problem.# #
SO4078#INEQUALITY AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION#The key focus and aim of the module is to provide students with a conceptual and operational understanding of the dynamics of inequality and social exclusion.

Additionally the module will examine the impact of media texts with particular reference to media discourses about those who are excluded. Finally, the module will refer to institutions and agencies engaging with the above themes.#Spring#
SO4087#SOCIAL TRENDS AND SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH#This course takes insights about contemporary societies drawn from sociological theory, and applies them empirically. The core sociological literature on a number of key, interlocking, themes characterising contemporary societies and social change will be examined (gender roles; the life course; the labour market; education; stratification, class, inequality and social mobility; the welfare state; values and attitudes -- religious change, sexuality, partnership formation). A broad range of empirical evidence relevant to the theoretical claims will be investigated, and students will be encouraged to use data sources and data analysis to critically address the theoretical claims. Linkages between social, economic and cultural change will be tested, in a national and comparative perspective. Students will be encouraged to think about what sociological theory and evidence has to say about the organisation of contemporary society, at a policy, political and personal level.# #
SO4088#SOCIOLOGY OF GLOBALISATION#The aim of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the various discourses of globalisation. It will explore some of the key meanings, history and differing theoretical perspectives and interpretations of globalisation in contemporary research, and will identify main policy issues related to economic, cultural and political globalisation. The focus will be the development of transnational communities and cultures including emergent new forms of worldwide political protest;  the challenge for trade unions; culture and the `global¿ and `local¿ divide;  the possibilities for a future global society or culture;  the inter-meshing of local-global interests and identities; the inequalities and social exclusion generated by economic globalisation; and the extent to which sociology ¿ like other disciplines ¿ needs to re-think many of its central concepts, debates and theoretical approaches in the light of globalisation processes. The analysis and discussion will be illustrated with international and Irish case studies.# #Izabela.Handzlik@ul.ie

SO4108#SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO GENDER AND MULTICULTURALISM#The syllabus will include theories that account for multiculturalism as a top-down response to cultural difference which produces a reification of `culture¿ and gender. It will also examine theories that identify multiculturalism as a new way forward to a `politics of recognition¿ and progressive gender politics. Examples of gendered cultural practices that raise critical questions for the effectiveness of multiculturalism, such as polygamy, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, unequal access to health care, education and rights of ownership will be examined. The course will consider how multiculturalism is reshaping the public spheres and civil societies of the West with particular implications for women and for gender relations. The module will be driven by questions relating to the relationships between gender, cultural diversity and global capitalism; how multicultural approaches to social cohesiveness reconceive belonging in gendered ways; and how gender relations affect and are affected by multicultural strategies for negotiating difference# #Breda.Gray@ul.ie

SO4128#SOCIOLOGY OF THE INTERNET#The aim of this module is to develop students¿ understanding of the manner in which sociology can illuminate the social impact of and social influences on the Internet. Students will engage with different conceptualisations of the Internet, for example, as a techno-social system. In examining the relationship between the Internet and society, technological determinist perspectives will be contrasted with constructivist explanations. In addition to addressing macro-sociological perspectives on the Internet, this module will also acquaint students with micro-sociological research on such phenomena as identity and community online. Such discussions will incorporate familiarisation with new methods emerging from Internet research. Students will also be introduced to debates regarding e-participation and digital exclusion. This module aims to develop students¿ appreciation of and ability to employ sociological concepts, theories and methods as key tools for investigating the Internet.# #
SO4138#SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION#This module addresses  the relationships between modernities and religion by: Considering religion in the work of Marx, Weber, Durkheim and Simmel as a basis for investigating the relevance of their work at the start of the twenty-first century; exploring the focus on religion¿s integrative function in the work of American sociologists such as Parsons, Berger¿s work on pluralisation and secularisation and Warner¿s rational choice theory; critically examining secularisation theory and process with reference to contemporary debates about post-secular society and global modernity. Substantive issues will also be addressed including migration and the increasing diversity of religious life, gender, sexuality and religion, religion and civil society and fundamentalisms in the modern world.# #
SO4148#SOCIOLOGY OF POWER: THE RELATIONAL AND PRACTICE#This module addresses one of the abiding and core concerns of sociology that is, the nature of social order, and the most appropriate methods to get at this phenomenon.  Among the most contentious and demanding aspects of this phenomenon confronted by social theorists are the conceptual demands of capturing and depicting its nature.  An exploration of the micro/macro binary offers sociology students the prime possibility of engaging in an intensive logical exploration and elucidation of these categories themselves - ontologically, in the logic of their conceptualisation and in their usage.  Weber¿s comparative historical approach at the macro level and the work of symbolic interactionists and ethnomethodologists at the micro level will be introduced to frame and set out the key underlying tensions as will a phenomelogical exploration around intentionality.   Bourdieu¿ theory of practice will then be addressed offering the potential of understanding how power and privilege are reproduced bringing together the structural and the subjective in a complex interweaving of the field of relations, the forms of capital and the embodied habitus.   An exploration of educational practices in the context of classed relations will offer the possibility of engaging the nature of subjectivity, embodiment, rationality and meaning and considering critiques of Bourdieu¿s work.   The process of othering offers a dual possibility of considering the complex nature of power, the reproduction of privilege, daily classification and a consideration of the subtle processes of differentiation and demarcation.  This also facilitates an engagement with less prominent aspects of Bourdieu¿s theory that is embodied history and individual strivings for recognition.# #
SO4158#SOCIOLOGY OF HIGHER EDUCATION#This module aims to provide students with an understanding of the sociology of Higher Education internationally and the processes impacting on it, including globalisation, massification; managerialism and masculinisation. It will locate these changes in the context of changing paradigms of Higher Education in Ireland and its nature and purpose. Policies related to Higher Education will be explored in the context of its relationship with the state, the economy and the paradox of gender. The relationship between students social class position; state¿s encouragement of access policies and its perceived elite/non-elite character.

Students will address questions such as : What have feminist theorists to say about objectivity and truth/ the distinction between knower and known/ self and other/ mind and body/ subject and object?  How might we understand culture and society differently if we incorporate reproduction, bodily work, and intimate relations in our research? What might be the limits of feminist standpoint, the idea that women, as a subordinated group, are in a better position to arrive at an adequate representation of social reality than men?  What kinds of questions guide feminist research? How do feminist researchers approach the objects of their research? What is the relationship between the object of research and the feminist researcher?# #
SO6042#FEMINISM(S), DIASPORA AND MULTICULTURALISM#This module examines how diasporic conditions and ways of life intersect with the politics of multiculturalism to bring about particular contestations in which women and their bodies become the symbolic/cultural sites upon which the moral order of national, ethnic and global politics is established. Many of the contradictions and complexities of diaspora and multiculturalism involve are addressed in feminist thought and politics. Feminists have argued, not just that multiculturalists have neglected gender injustices within cultures, but that multiculturalism may even facilitate the persistence of such injustices. In this module we examine the key sociological and political theories of diaspora and multiculturalism and address in particular the ways in which the theorisation of diaspora and multiculturalism has been critiqued from feminist perspectives.# #Breda.Gray@ul.ie

Discourse and genre (e.g. stylistic variation; case studies of specific genres). Standardisation is addressed diachronically from the point of view, for example, of the changing roles of prescriptive bodies such as the Real Academia Española and also from the perspective of ideologically driven language change, such as in the cases of language and gender, taboo language, 'political correctness', influence of English, etc. Attention is also paid to aspects of synchronic variation on parameters such as the geographical and the social.

Language and power in society. This theme will cover authority in language; language ideologies; language choice; language attitudes. A case study approach will be used, focusing on, for example, the hegemonic rationalisation of concepts such as 'nation'. 3.  Pragmatics and intercultural pragmatics (e.g. pronombres de tratamiento). 4. Language policy and language planning: social bilingualism; maintenance, shift and death; corpus/status/acquisition planning; practice, ideology and (c)overt policies.# #David.Atkinson@ul.ie

TL5001#RESEARCH PLANNING AND PREPARATION#The aim of this module is to help researchers successfully plan and manage their research process. This course will take researchers through the process of planning and managing their research. It offers practical insights into, and strategies to develop, the major factors affecting successful research, including, for example, a good research topic, motivation, peer support and supervision, creativity, focus, and research skills. Researchers will develop the cognitive, metacognitive, affective and social skills required to negotiate the research and writing process effectively.# #
TL5002#PLANNING AND PREPARATION#This module will focus on the process of pedagogical planning for curriculum delivery. It will facilitate active discussion across disciplines of the principles of curriculum design and will facilitate each participant¿s module delivery preparation strategies and processes. Topics will include an exploration of learning outcomes, linking assessment strategies with the planning and preparation process and exploring options for the use of teaching tools, technologies, resources and readings in support of teaching. Participants will engage interactively in the development of innovative and proactive teaching plans for one module and learn the processes where such planning activities can be applied to a range of different teaching contexts.# #Elaine.Vaughan@ul.ie
TL5003#CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN HIGHER EDUCATION#This module addresses the contemporary issues at the core of teaching, learning and scholarship in higher education. It will provide participants with an in-depth insight into the key developments and challenges in higher education and provide participants with the relevant knowledge and skills in order to be effective within this context. The context is ever changing and so it is difficult to predict all themes that this module will engage with over time.   However, the first iteration of the module will focus on three broad themes:  internationalisation of the curriculum and teaching international students, the use of creativity and innovation in education, and the role of different approaches in teaching such as, problem-based learning and research-linked teaching.  The module will commence with an overview of the current context of higher education in Ireland, the  development of higher education policy and the variety of challenges that have emerged due to the dynamic nature of the educational climate.   Participants will be equipped with the knowledge of learning systems and cultural norms and teaching across cultures, including the appropriate teaching/assessment strategies, building effective relationships in the classroom, supporting international students and overall best practice in relation to improving teaching and learning practices for both native and international students in relation to curriculum, pedagogy and assessment.     Creativity and innovation in the classroom will be explored, examining the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of imagination, creativity and innovation, while encouraging participants to explore their own creativity and the role of creative scholarship and education.  Varied approaches to teaching will be examined, with discussions on the   theories underpinning problem-based learning (PBL) and research-linked teaching approaches. Participants taking this module can expect to consider PBL from a number of inter-related dimensions, including curriculum development, problem design, small-group tutorials, designing appropriate assessments, and developing knowledge and capabilities. Different dimensions of research-led teaching will be explored in some detail: general research-informed teaching; integrating one's own research into teaching; student-led research; and the scholarship of teaching.   Participants will also be provided with an open forum for a contemporary issue of their choice, which they will lead and facilitate from their own disciplinary perspective.# #Mary.Fitzpatrick@ul.ie
TL5011#SCHOLARLY PRESENTATION AND DIALOGUE IN RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC WRITING#This module engages the scholar in the social dimension of their research and writing processes as ideas and text develop through multiple drafts to refine and ready the findings for conference presentation and for submission for publication. Students study the context(s) into which they write in order to determine the forms of social organization that motivate the discourse, the social roles that need to be understood and adopted in order to successfully develop the research idea, and the technologies that have emerged/are emerging to create/recreate our academic communicative lives. Scholars in this module develop criteria for evaluating the quality of that situated context and for assessing the appropriateness of their research and writing strategies with respect to their scholarly goals. Scholars then reflect on the development of their research and writing, identifying links between the strategies employed, the stages of the research and writing processes to which those strategies correspond and the effectiveness of the strategies in the context of the intent that motivated their development.# #Lawrence.Cleary@ul.ie
TL5012#TEACHING AND LEARNING OBSERVATION#This module explores the concept and practice of peer observation for enhancing pedagogy. The various terms and definitions of peer observation will be explored in addition to the various models of peer observation that prevail. The objectives of peer observation, from different perspectives, will be discussed. The principles and process of peer observation in practice described in terms of three different stages ¿ pre observation meeting and discussion, the peer observation itself and finally the post observation meeting. The general protocols for observing teaching will be outlined and discussed. Students will also focus on developing and generating criteria for peer observation. They will be exposed to the benefits of peer observation in addition to the potential pitfalls and how these may be avoided for both the observer and observee. The importance of managing and receiving feedback will be explored. Finally the process of writing up the peer observation report will be discussed and applied.# #Mary.Fitzpatrick@ul.ie
TL5021#FEEDBACK AND REVISION IN RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC WRITING#This module will enhance participants¿ understanding of and orientation towards: receiving feedback on academic writing, and revising and improving their own academic texts. The module will provide a supportive environment for participants to analyse and discuss their writing activities tasks and outputs. Participants will be asked to choose a focus for this module either their own academic writing or their use of writing activities in teaching at undergraduate level. Students are provided with supportive feedback ion their research and academic writing. The module will focus on how to revise and resubmit academic writing after feedback, particularly exploring how to respond to feedback that feels destructive or unhelpful. It will also focus on key skills that support a positive orientation towards revision. It will align with the other two modules by looking at the more difficult enhancement phases of writing based on critique and review of written work. Feedback and revision is often the part that people find most difficult and there are skills and orientations that people need in order to navigate it. The psychology of receiving and responding to feedback will be central to the topics in this module.# #
TL5022#ASSESSING STUDENT LEARNING AND GIVING FEEDBACK TO STUDENTS#Assessment is the principle driver of students¿ learning, and formative feedback is vital for students. In this module, participants will explore the advantages and disadvantages of various assessment methods, including exams, essays, assessed coursework in general, and the importance of students gaining formative feedback during their studies. Participants will explore how to address the following aspects of assessment: validity, reliability, transparency, authenticity, manageability and inclusiveness, and the need to diversify assessment so that students are not repeatedly disadvantaged by the over-use of particular assessment methods. Participants will also explore how student peerassessment can allow them to receive much more feedback on their learning, and how student selfassessment can be used to initiate productive feedback dialogues between tutors and students.  Throughout the module, feedback will be discussed, in particular ways of giving better formative feedback more efficiently and effectively to larger numbers of students.# #Angelica.Risquez@ul.ie

TL5091#PREPARING AN EFFECTIVE RESEARCH, WRITING AND PUBLICATION STRATEGY#This module will take participants through the process of planning and managing their research, writing and publication processes in order to develop an effective research, writing and publication strategy and a strong research profile, which is in line with their own professional development needs and priorities. The module will guide them through the following stages in order to achieve this goal.  1. Participants will prepare a research and writing output plan. This process will require participants to position their work in the context of their discipline, define their career and professional development goals, and design and develop an appropriate research, writing and publication strategy.    2. Participants will identify one piece of writing for publication from this output plan that will serve as a catalyst for learning throughout this module and will engage in a range of strategies to develop an effective research and writing strategy that will bring the identified piece of writing to publication. 3. Participants then reflect on the development of their research and writing, identifying links between the strategies employed, the stages of the research and writing processes to which those strategies correspond and the effectiveness of the strategies in the context of the intent that motivated their development.  4. Throughout the module, participants will be encouraged to make the link between themselves as writers and the students that they teach as writers and to develop a framework for teaching writing in their discipline.  5. Finally, participants will be introduced to the scholarship of teaching and learning and asked to draw from their own work to enhance and develop their teaching.# #
TL5092#RESEARCH LED TEACHING#The research-linked teaching module will address issues around the research-teaching nexus and review some of the relevant literature and current models outlining the role of research in teaching in HE. The term research-linked teaching will be defined and models from the published literature used to give participants insights into how they can adopt research-linked activities in their teaching and inculcate research related skills in their learners. Different dimensions of research-linked teaching will be explored in some detail: general research-informed teaching; integrating one's own research into teaching; student-led research; and the scholarship of teaching.  Some scholars are challenging the traditional view that research and teaching are separate activities.  This module will form a basis of discussions around how participants might adopt their courses to integrate research-teaching links and the strategies they might adopt to enable this.  Participants will also engage in discussions about enablers and barriers to integrating research-teaching links at institutional, policy and societal levels. They will also consider and reflect on the value of research linked teaching in their own disciplines.# #Mary.Fitzpatrick@ul.ie
TL5101#BLENDED LEARNING#1: Why blend?

TL5102#CONTEMPORARY LEARNING THEORY, REFLECTIVE PRACTICE AND PEER OBSERVATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION 2#This module focuses on contemporary learning theory in higher education and its merit and practical applicability in the classroom. The role of reflective practice, its rationale, and benefits, will be examined, and participants will be encouraged to build an evidence-based teaching approach by means of observation and critical reflection. The principles of teaching at higher education and the four key lenses of reflection will be examined and unpacked with a view to participants developing their own view on what constitutes teaching excellence. The importance of the teaching portfolio will be discussed and participants will be required to draft their own teaching portfolio with reference to the discussions and activities within the classroom.  In summary, assignments and in-class activities will allow participants to engage in reflective practice and evaluate its impact on their teaching and learning.# #Mary.Fitzpatrick@ul.ie
TL5111#CONTEMPORARY LEARNING THEORY, REFLECTIVE PRACTICE AND PEER OBSERVATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION 1#There are three key themes running through this module.    Firstly, this module will introduce teachers to contemporary learning theory in higher education, exploring its merit and practical applicability in the classroom.    Secondly, the role of reflective practice, its rationale, and benefits, will be explored, and participants will be encouraged to build an evidence-based teaching approach by means of observation and critical reflection. The principles of teaching in higher education and the four key lenses of reflection will be examined and unpacked with a view to participants developing their own perspective on what constitutes teaching excellence. The importance of the teaching portfolio will be explored and students will be required to draft their own teaching portfolio with reference to the discussions and activities within the classroom over the course of two semester    Thirdly, the various definitions of peer observation will be explored in addition to the various models of peer observation that prevail. The principles and process of peer observation in practice will be described in terms of three different stages - pre- observation meeting and discussion, the peer observation itself and, finally, the post- observation meeting. The general protocols for observing teaching will be outlined and discussed.  Students will also focus on developing and generating criteria for peer observation. They will be exposed to the benefits of peer observation in addition to the potential pitfalls and how these may be avoided for both the observer and observe. The importance of managing and receiving feedback will be explored.  Finally, the process of writing up the peer observation report will be discussed and applied. Students will then apply this learning in the engagement of peer observation with two of their colleagues in a triad over the semester.    In summary, assignments and in-class activities will allow students to engage in reflective practice and evaluate its impact on their teaching and learning.# #Mary.Fitzpatrick@ul.ie
TL5112#TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED LEARNING - THEORY AND PRACTICE#The delivery of the module is organised around these main headings: 1. Evaluating effective practice in technology-enhanced learning. This topic will focus on reflection around technology-enhanced learning in a way that directly applies to teaching context and discipline. During class time, participants will engage with an Oxford debate on the topic of flipped classrooms which concludes with an in-class online audience response activity. Principles of effective design and evaluation of learning impact will be explored. Cases of excellent teaching innovations and resources will be showcased, drawing in the work of communities of practice both within and outside our university, and placing special emphasis on open education and open educational resources.  2. Planning effective practice: principles of instructional design and e-tivities. This topic will give participants the opportunity to develop further their pedagogical approach as they discuss meaningfully how technologies could be utilised to enhance learning and solve current teaching dilemmas, drawing on the theoretical frameworks of pedagogical patterns (Laurillard, 2012) and Salmon's e-tivities (2013) and e-moderation principles (2011).  3. Developing and implementing: technologies for learning and open educational resources. This element of the curriculum will make intensive use of educational design storyboarding and dialogue around technological informed choices  5. Technical clinics: participants will have an opportunity to explore available tools within the contex of their teaching designs and will avail of techical advice during scheduled drop-in sessions.# #Angelica.Risquez@ul.ie
TL5122#WRITING FOR PUBLICATION: SCHOLARLY DIALOGUE AND PRESENTATION#This module will enable participants to widen and advance their research profile in two ways. Firstly, they will advance a draft of a piece of writing for publication that will serve as a catalyst for learning for this module. Secondly, they will examine a number of aspects of scholarly dialogue and presentation such as the following and relate them to their own disciplinary practice.  a) The development of a well-planned research project in preparation for publication. Particular attention will be paid to the different types of dialogue and publication present in specific discourse communities (books, research articles, conference presentations, proceedings, reports, reviews etc.), and to their different and complementary roles in the development of an individual's academic profile. b) The structure of research articles in individual disciplines. This will be studied in detail to enable participants to relate their own writing to conventions in their discipline. Research article introductions will be a particular focus. Literature reviews, methodology sections, data analysis, discussion and conclusions will also be examined. c) Effective communication in one or more discourse communities. This part of the module will allow participants to examine in detail the writing techniques of expert writers in their discipline and to relate them to their own writing. Aspects of academic writing such as argumentation, authorial stance and engagement will be identified and analysed both in peer-reviewed publications (by the course participants and others) and by draft texts by the participants. d) Identification of meta-cognitive, cognitive, affective and social strategies employed to further identify and develop the organisational structure of, and the ideas expressed in, a draft in its later stages of development. e) Evaluation of how the participants' practice, process and strategies as researchers and writers can be integrated into the teaching and learning environment at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Participants will discuss and reflect on how their work as researchers can inform their practice as teachers, supervisors and mentors. f) Consideration of research methodologies appropriate to the study of the effectiveness of teaching methods and/or student engagement and learning.# #
TL5132#FEEDBACK AND REVISION IN SCHOLARLY WRITING#This module is presented as part of an Academic Writers' Retreat in an intensive residential setting, which consists of a three-day event and includes using peer and expert input to revise, improve and bring an identified draft to publication. The module focuses on key skills that support a positive orientation towards feedback and revision, for instance, receiving, analysing and responding to feedback in a constructive manner that strengthens scholarship. Understanding the psychology of receiving and responding to feedback is central to adopting this positive orientation towards feedback and revision. Participants identify a piece of writing for publication that will serve as a catalyst for learning for this module. Throughout, participants are provided with supportive feedback on their research and academic writing at the revision phases of the writing process. The module focuses on how to revise and resubmit this identified piece after feedback, particularly exploring how to respond to feedback that feels destructive or unhelpful. Following the Writers' Retreat, participants are required to submit the revised and completed piece for publication.  Throughout the module, participants are encouraged to consider the metacognitive, cognitive, affective and social strategies employed in the revision stages of the writing process and to reflect on how this knowledge of the process and strategies they employed to achieve their goals can be integrated into the teaching and learning environment at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in order to enhance their pedagogical, supervisory and mentoring practices. After the Writers' Retreat, participants continue to work in peer relationships, engaging regularly in peer review of their own and one another's writing.# #

TL8013#DEVELOPING IDEAS AND ARGUEMENTS: WRITING INTO ACADEMIC COMMUNITIES#This module engages the scholar in the social dimension of their research and writing processes as ideas and arguments develop through multiple drafts. Students study the context(s) into which they write in order to determine the forms of social organization that motivate the form the discourse takes and the social roles that need to be understood and to which writers must appeal in order to successfully develop a research idea into an argument that is relevant to the field. Scholars in this module develop criteria for evaluating the quality of that situated context and for assessing the appropriateness of their research and writing strategies with respect to their scholarly goals. Scholars then reflect on the development of their research and writing, identifying links between the strategies employed, the stages of the research and writing processes to which those strategies correspond and the effectiveness of the strategies in the context of the intent that motivated their development. This module focuses on strategies pertinent to a text that is developing alongside ideas.# #

WS2011#INTRODUCTION TO ISSUES IN WOMEN'S STUDIES#This module will introduce students to feminist scholarship and will examine the ways that the meanings assigned to ægenderÆ influence the social world and also shape peopleÆs experiences and self perceptions. The course will begin with an exploration of what æfeminismÆ means and its relevance in womenÆs lives past and present. Reference will be made as appropriate to feminist theoretical perspectives such as liberal, Marxist, radical, postmodern and third wave. We will also look at the role WomenÆs Studies has played within the feminist movement.  The focus of the course will then move to the discussion of various issues that affect womenÆs lives.  Issues to be discussed include families and æthe familyÆ, culture and mass media, education, work and leisure, sexuality, and violence.  In the context of these issues we will also examine how the constructions of race, class and sexuality intersect with those of gender.#Autumn#
WS2012#WOMEN AND LITERATURE#In this study of the relationship between gender and literature we will look at the ways in which woman have been marginalised and under-represented in the literary canon. We will focus on the experiences of women writers and the critical reception their works have received. We will also focus on the representation of female characters in literature and explore and critique these limited and often stereotypical representations of women. Feminist literary theories emerge from an exploration of how gender has affected us as both writers and readers of literature. In this course we will look at key feminist texts such as Virginia WoolfÆs, A Room of OneÆs Own, Helene CixousÆs, The Laugh of the Medusa and Simone De BeauvoirÆs The Second Sex. These feminist literary theories will then be applied to an analysis of the work of different women writers; including contemporary Irish women poets Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill, Eavan Boland and Rita Ann Higgins, Angela CarterÆs fairytales and Kate ChopinÆs novel, The Awakening. We will also look at how women write and the ways in which women have altered inherited forms and styles to articulate a female voice in literature.#Autumn#
WS3102#INTRODUCTION TO FEMINIST THEORY#This module introduces students to the nature of feminist theory and to the main theoretical frameworks that have been developed to explain women's position in society (viz. Liberal; Radical; Psychoanalytic; Marxist and Socialist; Existentialist; Multicultural and Post-Modern). All of these theoretical approaches are examined with reference to key feminist debates and questions, for example, women and the family; women and work; womenÆs health; womenÆs rights; women and consumption; diversity amongst women û race, class, and sexuality; and women and politics. In this context we will do a close reading of the writings of one theorist related to the topic. The course begins by examining writer such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Emmeline Pankhurst from the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth century under the general heading of Liberal and Radical feminism. This is done in order to allow students to acquire a grounding in the foundations of the discipline.  Each subsequent week focus is concentrated on more specific issues, one per week such as ôWomen and Workö by reading Heidi Hartmann to examine Marxist and Socialist Feminism and ôWomen and Raceö by reading bell hooks to examine Multicultural and Global Feminism. Each week a different topic within a theoretical framework is covered and a close reading of an excerpt of the writings of one feminist writer is examined in order to give an overview of the many philosophical frameworks within feminism such as Liberal, Psychoanalytic, Existentialist etc.#Autumn#
WS3112#WOMEN, REPRESENTATION AND CULTURE#In this course we will look at images of women in popular culture, focusing on representations of women in literature, film, television and print media. In our study of women and popular culture we will identify the pressures created by popular depictions of women and how we, as consumers, are sold a particular version of femininity through these media representations. This analysis of women in popular culture will explore the impact these images have on women; both in terms of their influence on societal attitudes to women and their affect on womenÆs sense of their own worth and place in society.  The course begins with an exploration of the concept of hegemony and itÆs application for our analysis of popular culture. This involves a study of Antonio GramsciÆs work and an analysis of representations of women in fairytales. We then focus on images of women in advertising campaigns, using Naomi WolfÆs The Beauty Myth as a theoretical framework for our analysis. We then extend this analysis to cover women in television and film, focusing on the stereotypes we encounter in these media representations of women. Betty FreidanÆs The Feminine Mystique and Virginia WolfÆs short story æThe New DressÆ will then be analysed as representations of how women are æpunishedÆ for a failure to comply with socially acceptable notions of appropriate femininity. The course then focuses on æchit lit.Æ and representations of women in popular fiction, including the work of Maeve Binchy. The course finishes with an analysis of Sylvia PlathÆs novel The Bell Jar and her expression of the pressure faced by women to meet the standard of ænormalÆ femininity set by society.#Spring#Niamh.Hehir@ul.ie
WS4003#Contemporary Women's Writing#This course will introduce students to a number of key fictions by British and North American women authors, written between the 1950s and the present day. We will examine the ways in which these fictions respond to the changes in female experience in the second half of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first century, as well as exploring how these fictions reflect upon, and re-figure, conventional understandings of gender identity. Key issues for discussion will be the ways in which the texts respond to their social and cultural contexts, and how gender identity is shaped by location and place in these fictions. We will also explore the significant motifs that emerge across texts, such as women and madness; mother-daughter relationships; femininity and desire; fantasy and romance; the body; and the writing of race and gender.#Autumn#Sinead.Mcdermott@ul.ie
WS4004#GENDER: SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES#This module equips students with a critical understanding of key concepts in gender studies and feminist thought and how these are informed by, and inform, sociological enquiry. It offers in introduction to the main sociological perspectives on gender; key debates in feminist theory; debates in the study of masculinity; and perspectives on substantive topics such as work and care in the context of these frameworks. The module also examines the operation of gender divisions across national and transnational social contexts and their articulation with other major social divisions such as class, sexuality, ethnicity and race.# #
WS4011#FEMINIST PERSPECTIVES: AN INTRODUCTION#This module examines the concept of gender and debates about how it is defined and performed. We discuss what it means to be a woman or a man in society and how aspects of culture and the material world are gendered feminine and masculine. Gender involves the way society creates, patterns and rewards our understandings of femininity and masculinity. In this module we will consider how femininity and masculinity are constructed and how these interact with æraceÆ, ethnicity, class, sexuality and abilities.   Although women (and men) have been active in theorising the positions of women and in asserting womenÆs rights for centuries, the term æfeminismÆ only emerged in the late nineteenth century. There is no easy, æonce and for allÆ definition of feminism but the main focus of feminist thought is the significance of gender to thinking, culture and politics. Therefore, feminism challenges the masculine bias in Western thought to date. Although there are many different feminist schools of thought, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, it is important to keep an open mind with regard to how the different approaches may be more or less useful in different contexts. These are examined in relation to the social sciences and specific social issues.#Spring#
WS4018#GENDER, IDENTITY CULTURE AND SOCIETY#This interdisciplinary module examines the historical, literary, psychological and social construction of a gendered identity as it relates to women and men in society. How does a gendered identity come into being and how it is maintained and represented? The module examines the extent to which concepts like æidentityÆ, æselfÆ, ænationalityÆ are gendered notions and the consequences for women and men, both in theory and practice. A comparative approach is used to allow for exploration of these themes within multicultural contexts. Specifically, this module will focus on the interrelationship between gender identities and other social identities, including age, ethnicity, sexuality and family. Key themes will include socialisation and gender in childhood, gender and the body, sexuality, gender and nationalism, postcolonialism, media and diaspora.#Autumn#
WS4027#Gender and Modernity#This module re-reads modernity through the lens of feminist theory. It offers an analysis of the varied and competing gendered representations of modernity and a critical analysis of the gender politics of the modern. A central concern is the gender of bourgeois individualism. The course considers how our understanding of modernity changes by taking womenÆs experience rather than menÆs experience as paradigmatic. It examines the ways in which gender affects not just the factual content of knowledge of the modern, i.e. what gets included and what is left out, but the philosophical assumptions underlying interpretations of the modern. The complex and changing relationships of women to the diverse political, philosophical and cultural legacies of modernity are explored. In particular, the course investigates how the shift from a focus on production and rationalisation to a culture of consumption situates femininity at the heart of the modern and women as ideal subjects of an ideology of consumption. It also examines how feminism, although critical of the modern, has been deeply influenced by it.#Spring#
WS4028#THEORIES OF MULTICULTURALISM#This module examines what is meant by multiculturalism in different contexts and the dilemmas raised in debates between feminism and multiculturalism.  It considers the extent to which the state can be æneutralÆ with regard to ethnicity and nationalism and addresses the move in recent decades to embrace multiculturalism as a concept mainly used to represent nation-states as united in their heterogeneity. The module addresses the kinds of cases made for difference conscious notions of social justice. The module is centrally concerned with debates about the position of women in society about the relationship between feminism and multiculturalism. This it addresses theoretical approaches to  the relationship between multiculturalism and feminism.#Spring#
WS5011#PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACHES TO GENDER#The objective of the module is to seek out a path through the theoretical approaches in a way that enables course participants to locate themselves in relation to the different theoretical concerns and arguments. This means that alongside the discussion of different theoretical approaches we will be working towards developing individual responses to and positions with regard to the theories discussed. We will examine what is at stake in the different approaches and how particular concerns and foci have developed.#Autumn#Willemijn.Ruberg@staffmail.ul.ie
